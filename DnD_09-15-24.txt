SPEAKER1 0:00:00
Just give me the soundboard again. I want to join everyone in being silly. 
SPEAKER2 0:00:04
You and Hunter both are banned permanently 
SPEAKER1 0:00:06
from that thing. No! You guys cannot 
SPEAKER2 0:00:10
control yourself. 
SPEAKER1 0:00:13
I promise. 
SPEAKER2 0:00:15
Make sure you put all the thumbs up when you're done. Thank you. That's it? Uh... 
SPEAKER1 0:00:30
Yeah, I think I just heard that from her mic already. That wasn't me! Because I still don't have access to it. It's a cherry! Let me... It's channel banned. That's why. 
SPEAKER2 0:00:44
I'm not seeing it. 
SPEAKER5 0:00:46
I already removed it. 
SPEAKER4 0:00:49
Is Aliana coming or did she say she can make it? 
SPEAKER1 0:00:52
Aliana can make it. Okay. Ooh. Cat gets to play as the cat. What? 
SPEAKER4 0:01:00
That fits well. 
SPEAKER1 0:01:03
What? 
SPEAKER3 0:01:04
Yep, you are now the... 
SPEAKER4 0:01:06
It would also... Would I not need to connect to the internet thingy that you guys have? 
SPEAKER2 0:01:14
You would have to. 
SPEAKER1 0:01:18
She didn't know that. It's her first time. Gosh. 
SPEAKER4 0:01:20
Thank you! 
SPEAKER3 0:01:22
You gotta be gentle when it's her first time. 
SPEAKER1 0:01:23
Be gentle. It's her first time. You can't just break her on the first go. That's no fun at all. It's like ripping a bandaid off. 
SPEAKER4 0:01:33
No, boy. 
SPEAKER1 0:01:34
That is not an attractive way of doing that. 
SPEAKER2 0:01:36
I don't think you have any room to talk about what a first time experience is. 
SPEAKER4 0:01:42
What does that even mean? 
SPEAKER1 0:01:43
What does that mean? Yeah, I get that one. 
SPEAKER2 0:01:48
Anyways. As someone who has the hardware, I hope you'd understand how it works. 
SPEAKER1 0:01:55
That was the joke. But also I wouldn't. Um, no. Um, wait. What was I gonna say? Oh yeah, it would make sense for Janoon to be out of commission, too. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:05
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:02:06
Yeah, she's not even with the party. 
SPEAKER2 0:02:09
Hey. 
SPEAKER1 0:02:10
Cat can play the paraplegic cat tonight. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:13
Right fucking late. 
SPEAKER1 0:02:15
Yeah, tonight. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:17
What am I playing? 
SPEAKER1 0:02:19
You're playing as a paraplegic cat. You have no arms and no legs. And you have a dent in the top of your head. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:26
I refuse. 
SPEAKER2 0:02:27
Where did the dent come from? 
SPEAKER1 0:02:29
No, no, no. She has one. She has one. She has one. She has one. She has one. She has one arm and one leg still. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:32
I think the other one got cut off. 
SPEAKER1 0:02:33
For now. I can't believe the other one got cut off. Make them both. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:38
I was pretty sure that the, the, whatever it was from the ceiling got both arms. 
SPEAKER1 0:02:43
No. No, they just won. What? Oh, one leg. I was making a joke until the bird decides to, you know, culinarily cook it up. Reverse the rules. Some fried tabaxi? 
SPEAKER2 0:02:59
Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to flip the table. The cock ate the pussy instead of the pussy eating the dog. 
SPEAKER1 0:03:06
We can't talk about, we can't talk. Guys, we can't talk about cooking cats while Devin's in the chat. All right. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:12
All right. Yeah, it'll make me hungry. Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:03:15
What? 
SPEAKER2 0:03:16
Cat. 
SPEAKER1 0:03:17
Devin, I know it's like. 
SPEAKER3 0:03:18
Did you watch the last presidential debate? 
SPEAKER2 0:03:19
I, my mom just told me about the Haitian stuff. Cat. 
SPEAKER1 0:03:23
You know I'm Haitian. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:24
But you're not like. You're not like. 
SPEAKER5 0:03:26
You're not like. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:27
You're not like. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:28
You're not like. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:29
Really Haitian though. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:30
All right. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:31
Cat. Were you born and raised in Haiti? Cat. 
SPEAKER1 0:03:34
Answer the question, were you? 
SPEAKER2 0:03:35
No. I am in fact still Haitian. 
SPEAKER5 0:03:37
So then, therefore, you have ancestry that's Haitian. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:38
Doesn't mean you're more inclined to do it. Which means that he won't actually eat the cats. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:40
He'll just think about it and get really hungry. Of course. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:42
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:43
That's actually the line, but. So cat, none of my relatives, of which I'm not a Haitian, are Haitians. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:45
I'm a Haitian. I'm a Haitian. I'm a Haitian. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:48
I'm a Haitian. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:49
I'm a Haitian. I'm a Haitian. I'm a Haitian. I'm a Haitian. I'm a Haitian. I'm a Haitian. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:55
I'm a Haitian. 
SPEAKER1 0:03:56
I'm a Haitian. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:57
I'm a Haitian. 
SPEAKER1 0:03:58
I'm a Haitian. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:59
I'm a Haitian. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:00
And, um, congratulations. 
SPEAKER2 0:04:01
Once again, are what you would consider real Haitian. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:04
I'm going to inject right there. 
SPEAKER2 0:04:05
None of them have gone ahead and said, yum, let me have a cat. No. I'm going to inject right there because this would actually solidify my statement for why 
SPEAKER3 0:04:13
they would reject my food. 
SPEAKER1 0:04:15
And you said they're so picky about it, they would only eat a cat. Right. Yeah. So it's, it's a, it's a, it's a. only eat cats, so that kind of makes sense. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:26
I never said that. 
SPEAKER1 0:04:28
I had pulled pork ready for them, and you're like, no, no, no, don't do that to my family. They only eat certain food, special food. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:34
No, no, hold on. 
SPEAKER2 0:04:35
No. Too late. 
SPEAKER1 0:04:37
My grandmother on the Haitian side 
SPEAKER2 0:04:40
is a cat. 
SPEAKER4 0:04:42
May she rest in 
SPEAKER1 0:04:44
peace. Be nice to her. 
SPEAKER4 0:04:45
Is it because she didn't eat enough cat? 
SPEAKER2 0:04:47
No, it's because... 
SPEAKER1 0:04:49
It was from eating one. She had a disease. 
SPEAKER4 0:04:52
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 0:04:53
Cancer, thank you. 
SPEAKER4 0:04:55
She didn't eat cats. She would have had nine lives. 
SPEAKER1 0:04:58
She didn't eat cats. 
SPEAKER4 0:05:00
I don't think eating the cats would have had nine lives. Shh, technicalities. Otherwise, we'd have a very effective disposal unit 
SPEAKER2 0:05:07
for a... 
SPEAKER4 0:05:11
Unless... Can magic regrow limbs? 3.34, ladies and gents. 
SPEAKER1 0:05:18
Can magic 
SPEAKER2 0:05:19
regrow limbs? Yes. 
SPEAKER4 0:05:21
Okay. I couldn't remember the rules. 
SPEAKER2 0:05:23
So, there are certain spells 
SPEAKER3 0:05:26
that can regrow limbs. Yes. You have access to those right now. Not with your current character builds. 
SPEAKER2 0:05:34
Yes. 
SPEAKER4 0:05:34
I'm dying, like, every 30 seconds. 
SPEAKER5 0:05:38
So... 
SPEAKER2 0:05:39
Who keeps dying? 
SPEAKER4 0:05:42
Isn't it... 
SPEAKER5 0:05:43
I don't know. 
SPEAKER4 0:05:46
I feel like somebody always is, but I don't think it's the same person twice. 
SPEAKER1 0:05:51
Well, first it was me, and then it was Gizzard, and then it was Janoon. 
SPEAKER4 0:05:57
It's been... It was the... I forget his name, but the fairy, and then it was... 
SPEAKER2 0:06:03
Dan? 
SPEAKER4 0:06:06
Frollo. 
SPEAKER5 0:06:07
Frollo, more like barbecue. 
SPEAKER1 0:06:09
No, no, no. 
SPEAKER4 0:06:10
The other guy, the fighter. 
SPEAKER1 0:06:14
What? Chad? Chad died before Frollo did. 
SPEAKER4 0:06:21
Well, but it was Chad, so he automatically comes first and everything. 
SPEAKER1 0:06:27
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 0:06:27
So Chad died while all the rest of you cowered under carts. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:32
Then Frollo died, trying to save Gizzard. 
SPEAKER1 0:06:36
Then Janoon nearly died, 
SPEAKER3 0:06:38
trying to save Gizzard. 
SPEAKER1 0:06:41
Janoon just dipped out of the battle and went to a separate one, 
SPEAKER2 0:06:44
though, actually. 
SPEAKER1 0:06:45
No, no, I'm talking about, like, way back when. 
SPEAKER5 0:06:48
The water weird. 
SPEAKER1 0:06:50
Oh, oh. Mm-hmm. So I think at that point, all the rest of you nearly died as well, 
SPEAKER2 0:06:56
trying to save Gizzard. Then, after all that, 
SPEAKER1 0:07:02
Janoon nearly died to a dragon 
SPEAKER2 0:07:03
and decided, fuck this, I'm out, 
SPEAKER3 0:07:05
but not really, 
SPEAKER1 0:07:07
which I can't blame her for, 
SPEAKER2 0:07:08
because she took the entire grunt of a blue dragon's breath attack, which I thought would have just killed her. But it didn't. Maybe the oopsie on my part. Uh, yeah. Then you guys went to the cave, almost died. 
SPEAKER3 0:07:27
Here's the quest that Gizzard said. 
SPEAKER1 0:07:29
Which, on that note, actually, 
SPEAKER2 0:07:33
if we're ready, 
SPEAKER3 0:07:36
if everyone has their shit in order. 
SPEAKER1 0:07:38
Yeah, waiting for you. 
SPEAKER2 0:07:39
You're just rambling, dog. 
SPEAKER1 0:07:41
Keep yapping. What a yapper, bro. Telling you. Dude can go on for hours. 
SPEAKER2 0:07:49
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:07:50
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 0:07:50
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:07:53
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:07:53
That's what she said. You know what? That's exactly what she said. 
SPEAKER2 0:08:03
Hilarious. 
SPEAKER4 0:08:04
Like that. 
SPEAKER1 0:08:05
You know what? You hit the absent. 
SPEAKER2 0:08:08
Devon still won't admit that dirigibles are just the short bus of the sky. 
SPEAKER3 0:08:13
Fuck you. 
SPEAKER1 0:08:14
Anyway. 
SPEAKER4 0:08:14
Why is it that Devon called a dirigible conversation? 
SPEAKER1 0:08:18
Devon called literally like a fucking pill shaped, bloated, sack in the air, the sexiest form of flight. And that makes me really question his, 
SPEAKER2 0:08:27
um, 
SPEAKER1 0:08:27
I didn't say anything about sex appeal. 
SPEAKER3 0:08:29
I said it was efficient. 
SPEAKER1 0:08:31
Let's just be honest. Yeah. One point. Yeah. He said sexy. And let's just be honest. He thinks about plugs about it. 
SPEAKER2 0:08:36
There's just no getting around it. 
SPEAKER1 0:08:38
That's the only shape that dirigibles look like. And he's calling that sexy. 
SPEAKER2 0:08:41
I, I, I got questions. 
SPEAKER1 0:08:42
I never called it sexy. 
SPEAKER3 0:08:43
I said it was efficient. 
SPEAKER1 0:08:45
No, you, I bet it is. I see one. Yeah. Really gets the job done for him. Huh? Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 0:08:52
Oh, it doesn't. 
SPEAKER1 0:08:54
The most convenient, low, uh, personnel carrying. Anyways, focus. I'm all over the place. Sorry. That wasn't to you guys. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:07
That was to myself. 
SPEAKER3 0:09:12
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:09:13
You guys like dirigibles? Okay. All right. Not only will your dungeon master remember this, 
SPEAKER3 0:09:21
but we're going, we're going to do something here. 
SPEAKER1 0:09:23
Yeah, right, please. 
SPEAKER5 0:09:24
I hope this practice course will help you guys. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:26
okay. Hi, Holly. 
SPEAKER3 0:09:31
Hey, hey, hey. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:32
You know, umm... 
SPEAKER3 0:09:36
Are you always been trying to get your shells that no one's got? 
SPEAKER1 0:09:38
No, it's, it's came next episode. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:38
It's probably it's a week, I don't know why. 
SPEAKER4 0:09:41
You're not going to get a good one right from now on. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:41
You can just hear the beer pouring. 
SPEAKER1 0:09:44
Um, that deep. I should've said procedures. Yeah, that really would be bad if somebody. don't say painful gef. 
SPEAKER4 0:09:46
It's okay about it two minutes ago first. And that of six months ago? I don't mind. 
SPEAKER1 0:09:47
Anyways, so. 
SPEAKER4 0:09:47
You for that time you do Рn? 
SPEAKER3 0:09:47
Who's expecting me, 
SPEAKER2 0:09:48
come on in. 
SPEAKER5 0:09:52
I have not stopped gurgling for five days, and more yellow and green has come out of me through my lungs than I thought was physically possible. 
SPEAKER1 0:10:02
Are you okay? 
SPEAKER5 0:10:04
That's... 
SPEAKER2 0:10:06
Devin, what? 
SPEAKER3 0:10:08
I'm gonna make it. 
SPEAKER2 0:10:10
Okay... 
SPEAKER4 0:10:12
Is this like the tornado that you're like, I'm fine? 
SPEAKER3 0:10:18
I'm gonna take a second Advil. We're gonna be good. We're gonna be Gucci. Anyway, last we left off... 
SPEAKER2 0:10:26
Modern medicine. 
SPEAKER1 0:10:27
Well, as you're good and drugged up... 
SPEAKER5 0:10:29
Yep. You're good to go. 
SPEAKER2 0:10:31
Last we left off, the party had gone up, undergone a bit of a process to reclaim some items, get care afforded to their tabaxi friend, Janine, and to basically do what they could the morning prior to dissent with the rest of the guard team back. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:10:51
To caves and the outskirts of something. I'm going to preempt this, because I know you guys were heading back to the guard camp to begin with. 
SPEAKER2 0:11:02
As you arrive, Anton Koki is waiting with a squad of roughly six additional other heavily armored and carrying various weapons members of this, of Dawn's Guard specifically. 
SPEAKER5 0:11:19
Hello. 
SPEAKER2 0:11:21
They look much more well equipped than the Emberwatch that Jerry patrols. All of them have this determined look across their face. As you approach, she begins to instruct us in a form of, as we begin your journey out to the crevice. 
SPEAKER3 0:11:37
You are the members of the party who know where this crevice leads. 
SPEAKER2 0:11:40
As you approach, she says, hello. 
SPEAKER3 0:11:43
Are you ready to depart? 
SPEAKER2 0:11:46
Anton Koki, you're welcome. I, uh, yes I believe we are. Okay. Yeah, we could still use some supplies, but, ah, it seems the town is kind of limited before we had to check. That is unfortunate in nature that we're forced to work in the dark. 
SPEAKER3 0:12:09
This is not necessarily a strong nation when it comes to items of art. 
SPEAKER2 0:12:15
However- However, our means of great determination seem to be the same. 
SPEAKER3 0:12:31
Well, then, I will have your party lead the way. 
SPEAKER2 0:12:35
Lead the way? You know the way. 
SPEAKER3 0:12:58
Take the lead of this formation. There is no cart this time. They're all roughly in these two columns. After the beginning of your party, I'll let you guys take up the upper and front echelon. Anthe Kokek stands not necessarily next to you in Slarkov, but takes up a space behind you. 
SPEAKER2 0:13:16
You begin your journey in its outside self. 
SPEAKER3 0:13:20
We're let out of the gate and instructions given are to have it sealed until their return. 
SPEAKER2 0:13:30
In Slarkov? Can I get a survival check? 
SPEAKER1 0:13:35
Ah, shit, okay. Let me... 
SPEAKER4 0:13:50
It could've been worse. 
SPEAKER3 0:13:52
Yeah, it could've been much worse. 
SPEAKER2 0:13:54
You don't have darkness. 
SPEAKER1 0:13:58
I am a little bit confused on that ruling still. 
SPEAKER5 0:14:02
Um... Because... 
SPEAKER1 0:14:04
We had been playing as if I had this whole time, but then for some reason it wasn't on my character sheet last time. But then... The session after... I think Natali found something about Kenku's with darkvision? I-I'm sorry, I'm still a little confused on that one. 
SPEAKER2 0:14:20
Because... 
SPEAKER1 0:14:21
I'm pretty sure he had it. 
SPEAKER2 0:14:27
Okay. Let's pick the wood. Yeah, I'm... I'm... I'm... 
SPEAKER1 0:14:36
On World Anvil, I'm seeing that they have a darkvision of 60 feet. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:40
Yes. So you should have darkvision of 60 feet. Okay. So. 
SPEAKER5 0:14:44
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:45
You go ahead and... 
SPEAKER2 0:14:48
You go Gerry. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:50
So you go ahead and... Be in the dark, unlit cavernous forest. 
SPEAKER5 0:14:56
Find yourselves a gun. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:58
So you might realize... Quickly realize that while the trails in the forest sometimes will shatter, the lack of any equal light beyond the city itself with all the darkvision which causes all of the shadows to be cast in the same direction quickly means that you're struggling to find the trail you thought was the most probable last time. 
SPEAKER2 0:15:24
Especially as this time you have seen a rampant sea of light. 
SPEAKER5 0:15:28
That's... 
SPEAKER2 0:15:29
While the darks have left before you. 
SPEAKER5 0:15:33
Your first hour of travel since we got to the bottom of the forest has been as you end up wandering aimlessly and realizing that you don't know the real idea of the real world. 
SPEAKER2 0:15:44
I think... 
SPEAKER1 0:15:45
Isagan realizes this but he tries to play it off. Like, he totally knows what he's doing and he just tries to reroute. 
SPEAKER2 0:15:57
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:15:58
I'll need a second to sort of check. The next hour of travel. Mhm. 
SPEAKER2 0:16:13
Okay. For the 16th, you do eventually pick up on part of the trail that you were following earlier. Uh, what really draws you to it is... You point yourself towards the direction of the falls. The falls that you remember having to skirt past on your initial trip down this. The falls that had behind them and built on them. Very large. Very unreachable. If you make your way through this trail, past this falls and past that clearing area that gave you that large menacing view for those of you who couldn't see it in the distance, that means primarily reaching... Past the falls. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:54
Past the falls. 
SPEAKER2 0:16:55
Past the falls. Past once again. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:57
Past the falls. 
SPEAKER3 0:16:58
Past the falls. And then the other side of this tributary. 
SPEAKER2 0:17:00
And then the other side of this tributary. 
SPEAKER5 0:17:01
And cyan over the form. And then the other side of this tributary. And then the other side of this tributary. 
SPEAKER3 0:17:05
During this second hour of travel, most of the soldiers begin to broker themselves and instead of lighting torches what you notice is that they direct few figures that are of more elderly descent to the front of their two respective columns, while everyone else places their hands forward on the armor. on the armor kind of like a a following leader-ish type of formation following those who can make out 
SPEAKER2 0:17:33
some vision in the darkness. And Kokek goes to whoever is not navigating whoever is near him 
SPEAKER3 0:17:39
and says, the rest of you is worth it if you are traversing this area of the world. Do not ever venture into what's next. It's a bit of a tenuous relationship to maintain with the dead. The denizens of the Underdark they have allowed us to settle here. We do have some political association with them, however 
SPEAKER2 0:18:20
they very much don't want this to be true. Wanton. 
SPEAKER3 0:18:23
Terrible. 
SPEAKER1 0:18:29
And for note, we're not going in the same direction as them, right? 
SPEAKER3 0:18:33
No. Okay. As you're traversing, you'd be the one to be able to make out the visual aspect of this. You look kind of off to your front right. And you see that this is not one small falls. It's like a more massive version of essentially it's the greater part of Niagara Falls is down here in this cave. And built into it and over it, over this slit that the water seems to spill from. You can see the massive dark stone. Dark stone orifications that are built into the wall. Including these large scoops that kind of jut out of the cave face. And seem to be collecting the water at some sort of point. The entire thing ends up looking like this oddly constructed flattened wall. 
SPEAKER1 0:19:28
Interesting. Very well. We'll keep our distance, Hermit, then. 
SPEAKER2 0:19:37
Okay. Sorry. 
SPEAKER3 0:19:44
Um. 
SPEAKER2 0:19:45
That's it. But. 
SPEAKER3 0:19:48
Your third hour of your journey lies ahead. N'Zam, are you still leading the boat? 
SPEAKER1 0:19:56
I'd say if everything- if we've been going, like, progressing okay from now, yeah. He'll just keep the course. 
SPEAKER2 0:20:04
Okay. Alright. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:07
Where's your voice? 
SPEAKER3 0:20:08
Over. What was the other check? Ooh. 
SPEAKER5 0:20:11
Oh. Oopsies. 
SPEAKER2 0:20:13
Nope. 
SPEAKER5 0:20:14
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:15
This'll be interesting. Oh, great. Is that a natural one? 
SPEAKER2 0:20:18
No, it wasn't. Close. No, it wasn't. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:21
All right. 
SPEAKER2 0:20:22
So, um, this is the first time I've seen this. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:23
I mean, I've seen it before. 
SPEAKER5 0:20:24
I've seen it before. 
SPEAKER2 0:20:25
I think it's a bit different. 
SPEAKER3 0:20:26
But, um, I think it's a bit different. 
SPEAKER2 0:20:27
So, uh, I'm pretty sure that this is the first time. 
SPEAKER5 0:20:28
I mean, I think it's a bit different. I think it's a bit different. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:30
I'm pretty sure that enhancement is going to be a bit different. I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 0:20:32
Close. 
SPEAKER5 0:20:33
No, it wasn't. 
SPEAKER2 0:20:34
Just need to make sure, you know? Let me get my dice out. 
SPEAKER3 0:20:36
Oh, God. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:37
During this whole travel, can I have preemptively sort of, not hidden in one place, but tried 
SPEAKER5 0:20:38
to obscure amidst everybody else who's walking? You can. 
SPEAKER3 0:20:40
The soldiers are not exactly completely non-vigilant. 
SPEAKER2 0:20:41
So, I have to make sure you know. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:42
You can. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:43
I don't know. I'm going to have to go back to the back. I don't know. I'm going to have to go back to the back. 
SPEAKER2 0:20:47
I'm going to have to go back to the back. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:48
I don't know. I don't know. I'm going to have to go back to the back. I don't know. I don't know. 
SPEAKER2 0:20:53
I don't know. I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 0:21:02
I don't know. I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:04
I will have you make a stone. 
SPEAKER4 0:21:05
Uh, okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:06
I'm going to put my hood up, so I get advantage. 
SPEAKER4 0:21:07
And... 
SPEAKER2 0:21:08
24. 
SPEAKER4 0:21:13
I feel very hidden. Don't know if I am, but I feel hidden. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:15
I feel very hidden. 
SPEAKER2 0:21:17
The time... Only time will tell how hidden you actually are. But, for purposes you can use it yourself. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:20
Relatively hidden. 
SPEAKER3 0:21:21
What are you trying to do? 
SPEAKER5 0:21:22
I know you're trying to use your skills. 
SPEAKER2 0:21:23
I know. You're trying to use your abilities. I know. I'm trying to use my abilities. I'm trying to. 
SPEAKER3 0:21:28
I'm trying to. I'm trying to. I'm trying to. I'm trying to. while you are, um, not seen. 
SPEAKER4 0:21:37
I just wanna... not get seen. 
SPEAKER2 0:21:40
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:21:41
Like, I wanna follow along, but I don't want people to see me. Uh, just in case they turn on us, or just in case something up ahead or on the side or behind is evil and wants to eat us, I would prefer to remain uneaten. The, uh, the goal of mine. 
SPEAKER3 0:21:58
You know, the big goal for me. 
SPEAKER4 0:22:00
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:22:01
Um, not to eat you. 
SPEAKER4 0:22:05
Not working so well for other people, so I'll try my hand at not getting eaten. 
SPEAKER1 0:22:10
What? 
SPEAKER3 0:22:11
I don't think it's part of your own self-perception. 
SPEAKER4 0:22:16
All 21 minutes of it. 
SPEAKER3 0:22:18
Yeah. Exactly. 
SPEAKER1 0:22:23
To be fair, Janoon got only partially digested. That's not totally... Totally being eaten. 
SPEAKER4 0:22:29
No, I don't wanna be partially digested. I don't wanna be digested at all. That is my goal. And thus, I will hide. 
SPEAKER3 0:22:35
Don't wanna be tasted? 
SPEAKER2 0:22:36
Nope. 
SPEAKER5 0:22:37
Nope. 
SPEAKER1 0:22:38
And what a buzzkill. 
SPEAKER2 0:22:39
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:22:43
That is not... 
SPEAKER4 0:22:49
Betrayed. I mean, that's also something I really care about. 
SPEAKER1 0:22:51
No! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 0:22:57
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER4 0:22:58
I'm just saying. Everyone that we're traveling with is inherently suspicious. And paranoia saves lives. Alright, since we're gonna make that comment. 
SPEAKER3 0:23:03
I think I'll break out my whiteboard and just start making a countdown how many untoward 
SPEAKER2 0:23:14
comments I have to deal with. Untoward comments?! That's number one. 
SPEAKER4 0:23:23
What is the criteria for this whiteboard? for this whiteboard. I'm curious. 
SPEAKER2 0:23:29
Wouldn't you like to find out? 
SPEAKER4 0:23:34
Just because I have a healthy perspective of something. 
SPEAKER3 0:23:39
Anyway. In Songhan, 
SPEAKER2 0:23:42
you navigate 
SPEAKER3 0:23:45
from another hour. 
SPEAKER1 0:23:47
And at first, 
SPEAKER3 0:23:48
think that you're reaching this crevasse. At first, 
SPEAKER2 0:23:53
you kind of take a jackknife tail back into the woods. 
SPEAKER3 0:24:00
Keep walking. Keep walking. And you eventually meet the cliff face. 
SPEAKER2 0:24:05
And there doesn't appear to be anything. So you backtrack again. And you walk. And the walls sound closer and farther and closer until you can't really determine where you are. You are now lost again. 
SPEAKER1 0:24:23
Yippee. 
SPEAKER3 0:24:24
Can I get a X36? 
SPEAKER1 0:24:27
Oh no. Wait. Okay. Um. 
SPEAKER5 0:24:33
Um. 
SPEAKER3 0:24:41
You do manage, as you are leading this party, 
SPEAKER2 0:24:44
and you, by virtue of it, 
SPEAKER3 0:24:45
are kind of farther ahead. You do look up from the map in your moment of confusion 
SPEAKER5 0:24:50
before walking face first 
SPEAKER3 0:24:51
to the wall of greatness. But this is not the right way to go. One more survivor check for me. If you would. 
SPEAKER2 0:25:03
I'm gonna pause right there. 
SPEAKER1 0:25:05
Where are you going, bird? Songhan's going to, um, kind of back out of the brambles. Visibly, like, very, like, kind of embarrassed and just, like, um, uh, startled and hold the map out in front of him. And kind of, like, turn it over in his hands. And just look at Michi confused. Michi's gonna 
SPEAKER2 0:25:31
wobble up to him. 
SPEAKER1 0:25:33
Let me see if I can find some 
SPEAKER2 0:25:35
noticeable landmarks. Can I investigate this? 
SPEAKER1 0:25:38
Sure. 
SPEAKER2 0:25:40
Can you make a 
SPEAKER1 0:25:41
stopwatch? Yes. 
SPEAKER2 0:25:45
Just give me one moment. Sorry, I was just double-checking 
SPEAKER1 0:25:55
something. That is a 23. So, 
SPEAKER3 0:26:07
when the bird went to turn to the other side, 
SPEAKER2 0:26:11
you can see the wall. 
SPEAKER3 0:26:12
It's actually just 
SPEAKER2 0:26:13
right here. 
SPEAKER1 0:26:17
Stop. Wall. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:23
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:26:26
Well, you went the wrong way, 
SPEAKER2 0:26:29
so maybe if we follow these tracks 
SPEAKER1 0:26:33
this way and along that way back towards the waterfall, we should be able to make it. Okay. Songhan's gonna watch as Michi, like, points this, like, trail out, uh, and start leading everyone, 
SPEAKER4 0:26:51
uh, hopefully now in the right... 
SPEAKER2 0:26:53
direction. 
SPEAKER1 0:27:11
Bird did good. You did good. 
SPEAKER5 0:27:14
Just... 
SPEAKER2 0:27:15
miss my remembrance. 
SPEAKER1 0:27:17
But we got this. 
SPEAKER2 0:27:18
You got this. 
SPEAKER1 0:27:19
Good job. Proud of you. He's gonna kinda 
SPEAKER2 0:27:23
pop up and 
SPEAKER1 0:27:23
puff up his chest a little, like, um, obviously, uh, taking in, like, the praise. And, yeah, he'll just start off a little bit more confident now in the right direction. 
SPEAKER2 0:27:40
His last hour 
SPEAKER3 0:27:41
of meditation made two events 
SPEAKER2 0:27:43
reach back to me. I was not familiar 
SPEAKER3 0:27:46
with one thing. One thing was that Michi 
SPEAKER2 0:27:49
moved you 
SPEAKER3 0:27:50
forwards to the better part of the world. And then, many days, tried to convince yourself to go there. Days? Hours. 
SPEAKER2 0:28:02
Hours. Well, 
SPEAKER1 0:28:06
here we are again. 
SPEAKER2 0:28:09
Old friend. 
SPEAKER1 0:28:13
Bidet. 
SPEAKER2 0:28:15
So, 
SPEAKER3 0:28:15
what should we prepare ourselves for? 
SPEAKER1 0:28:19
Uh, a lot of crawling 
SPEAKER2 0:28:20
unless you get some good diggers. How many days 
SPEAKER1 0:28:24
are we in this game, 
SPEAKER2 0:28:25
I'm sure? 
SPEAKER5 0:28:25
I don't know. So, 
SPEAKER1 0:28:25
so, Insancon is going to, 
SPEAKER2 0:28:30
like, 
SPEAKER1 0:28:31
pantomime? Or like, um, 
SPEAKER3 0:28:33
like, 
SPEAKER1 0:28:34
a game of charades. He's going to try to enact out a dramatic retelling of, um, the events that transpired. 
SPEAKER2 0:28:44
Like, 
SPEAKER1 0:28:45
he's going to crawl. He's going to indicate, 
SPEAKER3 0:28:47
like, 
SPEAKER1 0:28:47
a tunnel with his hands and then, like, do a crawling motion. Uh, and then pretend to, fall and then pretend to fight some things. I also realized 
SPEAKER3 0:29:02
we shared 
SPEAKER2 0:29:03
our findings. You found findings? 
SPEAKER3 0:29:10
Yes. We took the creatures that you dropped near us and 
SPEAKER2 0:29:16
cross-referenced them in the library of monsters 
SPEAKER3 0:29:20
that Adventurist possesses. 
SPEAKER2 0:29:23
Lovely. The stalactite-type 
SPEAKER3 0:29:26
creatures that you fought are known as robots. They are aberrations. guides basically mention that they are not the best critical, but if you are going to have to spar with them, melee attacks are all but useless. Spells that do not 
SPEAKER2 0:29:49
have to fight to the height of the creature 
SPEAKER3 0:29:51
are going to be the best strategies 
SPEAKER1 0:29:53
to take. 
SPEAKER3 0:29:53
I understand that your 
SPEAKER2 0:29:56
monk 
SPEAKER3 0:29:57
shall fight against 
SPEAKER1 0:29:59
them. 
SPEAKER2 0:30:01
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:30:04
One of our members is more inclined to be unpaimed. Are we able to make use of our stalactite? 
SPEAKER2 0:30:14
I believe so, yes. Quite a bit of room in there. Once you're past them. 
SPEAKER1 0:30:20
I'm so sorry. I was just going to say he just nods. 
SPEAKER2 0:30:23
I'm just trying to figure out 
SPEAKER4 0:30:28
who he's pointing to as to who the dude is. 
SPEAKER3 0:30:34
As he points back and indicates he doesn't necessarily point anyone out. Go and make a perception check. 
SPEAKER5 0:30:42
I hate perception checks. 
SPEAKER1 0:30:44
Not all of us seduced her. Just her. 
SPEAKER4 0:30:49
I can see other I can't see things and things can't see me and I'm happy to leave. 
SPEAKER2 0:30:53
it that way. 17. 17. Well, you do see one figure, while the rest of them do have a variety of 
SPEAKER3 0:31:05
spears and a couple of them have larger pikes and swords, there is one figure in the same uniform that instead has a, what looks like it should have been like a brace around their arm that ends in almost a fingerless fashion glove that has sigils wrapped all over it. 
SPEAKER2 0:31:28
Okay. I want to keep an eye on this guy. Okay. And I would assume that we are free to use magic while we're in combat with these monsters in here, yes? We are outside of the city limits, and due to the nature of this, we have been sanctioned to make use of the place. Very well. Appreciate it. The council has given us the order. Well, who's first? Trek, in addition, I should also note, the other beasts that you let us investigate, 
SPEAKER3 0:32:06
those are known as intellectual goblins and are of the two bigger tribes. 
SPEAKER5 0:32:11
Hmm. 
SPEAKER3 0:32:13
It says they are trolls created by creatures known as Olypids. Others know them more closely as mind flayers. Part of the reason we've been sent so early with such discretion is that if there is beginnings 
SPEAKER2 0:32:36
of a mind flayer call, you must step out, or else to us. 
SPEAKER3 0:32:40
If you feel any intrusion into your mind, anything at all, shield yourself. 
SPEAKER2 0:32:46
They have been known to be able to sneak to the heat. The bodies are safe. 
SPEAKER4 0:32:51
It found no trace of possibilities for tangents. 
SPEAKER2 0:32:54
And their không-ездеу the Bhik Site are not forgotten about any longer. 
SPEAKER5 0:32:58
It's been given as a coping mechanism by that of cool. 
SPEAKER3 0:33:00
As I'm speaking, it's very poor and similar to those sp nutrials in the Book of Dep практи topography since I did the research before – 
SPEAKER2 0:33:09
Have the aj 
SPEAKER3 0:33:21
He's three proportionless, all that I have. He presents to you three rings of mind-shifting. 
SPEAKER4 0:33:36
Can I grab one? 
SPEAKER3 0:33:39
Of course. Be my guest. I will need these for Taric once this point is dealt with. 
SPEAKER4 0:33:46
Can I just reach out to take one? 
SPEAKER3 0:33:49
Yeah, sure. 
SPEAKER1 0:33:50
He'll know where you are, but sure. 
SPEAKER4 0:33:51
Oh, I spoke. Presumably he knows where I am. 
SPEAKER1 0:33:55
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:34:04
Son will also take, like, a ring if he can. 
SPEAKER3 0:34:13
I was taking a third one. 
SPEAKER1 0:34:21
Or it's gonna, like, gesture forward towards, uh, Michi to take the ring. And he's gonna go, Take it, my friend. 
SPEAKER2 0:34:34
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:34:34
I bested three of them single-handedly. I'm sure you did. 
SPEAKER2 0:34:40
But my mind is, well, a steel trap, you say. Don't worry. You need it. 
SPEAKER1 0:34:46
Take it. I'm just gonna kind of stare at him. Go on. Take it. We don't need you turning into what the cat was before. That would not happen. 
SPEAKER2 0:35:18
I have my axes. 
SPEAKER5 0:35:20
I would... 
SPEAKER1 0:35:21
I wouldn't kill it if it attempted to take over my mind. I think you should really take it. I'm just gonna grab it from the guy's hand and put it in Ord's face. Here. Here. Think of it as a... A trophy. For the ones you killed. Very well. He'll take it and look at it and sort of... A new look. He'll sort of... Taking in how shiny it is. Or just the way that it looks. And sort of triumphantly, he'll put it on one finger. Give a little smile. 
SPEAKER3 0:36:10
If you are curious, the item is in the Boundary. You should have access to it in your favor. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:16
Do we have to attune to it? Or can we just use it? Use it. 
SPEAKER2 0:36:21
Make sure. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:22
I do not have it in mine. 
SPEAKER2 0:36:26
It does require attunement, sadly. 
SPEAKER3 0:36:28
It does require attunement. If you want to, you can track the attunement either before you begin your descent or as you begin your descent. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:37
Okay. I guess I'll do that. I don't see it anywhere in my inventory, but I'll just assume it's there. 
SPEAKER3 0:36:41
It's in... If you go to Items under your tabs, you should see it there. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:45
I see... I'm in Inventory. I just don't see anything. 
SPEAKER3 0:36:49
Not the inventory. 
SPEAKER2 0:36:50
I see... 
SPEAKER5 0:36:51
I see... 
SPEAKER2 0:36:52
I see Details, Inventory, Features, Spells, Effects, and Biography. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:57
I don't see items. She's looking at the UI. No, no. 
SPEAKER1 0:37:00
It's items in the general UI. 
SPEAKER3 0:37:01
Not in the... Not in the... The chat. If you go to the chat messages up top, go to above what the Comedy account is. 
SPEAKER2 0:37:05
Ah, okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:37:06
If you go to Items, it should be there. 
SPEAKER1 0:37:07
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 0:37:08
It says... It says... It says... 
SPEAKER1 0:37:11
It says... 
SPEAKER3 0:37:12
It says... 
SPEAKER4 0:37:13
It says... 
SPEAKER5 0:37:14
It says... It says... It says... It says... It says... 
SPEAKER3 0:37:19
It says... So, those do require some tuning. Do you need timing down? Or is this dissent volume up to be shortened? Begin that process while you're dissenting. 
SPEAKER2 0:37:36
Unlocking? 
SPEAKER5 0:37:37
Potentially unlocks. 
SPEAKER3 0:37:38
Why don't we stop here for a moment. Attune to your new items, and then begin to uncheck online. 
SPEAKER2 0:37:45
My men will take a look at you now. 
SPEAKER3 0:37:47
Time Senate as the first item. That means you are now unlocked. 
SPEAKER4 0:37:49
Can I grab Michi and sort of step aside from everybody else for a second? 
SPEAKER1 0:37:58
Sure. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:01
I'm not going back down there. 
SPEAKER2 0:38:04
But you must, my friend. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:07
I am not crawling through that. 
SPEAKER1 0:38:10
I mean, you didn't crawl through it before, but you'll be completely fine. You were alright. You slept most of the time. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:19
I am alright if we do the other solution, but I will not do it on my own. 
SPEAKER1 0:38:26
Do you want me to carry you again? 
SPEAKER4 0:38:28
I'm not crawling through it. 
SPEAKER1 0:38:30
I'll hold you like a baby. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:33
Fine. 
SPEAKER1 0:38:35
I knew it. You love it. Well, um... 
SPEAKER5 0:38:47
I guess we're, uh... 
SPEAKER1 0:38:49
doing this again. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:52
I will stay here otherwise. I'm not going to go down... 
SPEAKER1 0:38:55
I'm not... 
SPEAKER2 0:38:56
No. I can grease you up. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:59
Just slip you on down the... That sounds incredibly uncomfortable. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:03
It is extraordinarily uncomfortable, but it's not that bad. We got out of here the first time. 
SPEAKER4 0:39:12
Since it happened so well the first time, we're going to try and tempt fate again? 
SPEAKER2 0:39:16
Well... I don't think we really have a choice here. We die if we go in, we die if we don't. 
SPEAKER4 0:39:27
I'd be more content if it's not dying at all, but if we have to, I will not be crawling down the... however long it was, of stupid cave. 
SPEAKER2 0:39:37
I mean, you can crawl back in the bag, like I said. 
SPEAKER4 0:39:41
Now? Or do you want to wait until everyone leaves, heads down? 
SPEAKER5 0:39:47
Um... 
SPEAKER2 0:39:48
Um... 
SPEAKER5 0:39:49
I'd prefer not to be the last time. 
SPEAKER2 0:39:51
I'd prefer not to be the last time 
SPEAKER1 0:40:15
Can force take the shape of Michi? 
SPEAKER2 0:40:17
Can force take the shape of Michi? Um... 
SPEAKER4 0:40:20
I can take anybody's shape. 
SPEAKER2 0:40:22
I like the size. 
SPEAKER4 0:40:24
No, I... well, I can go... I have to stay as a... I think I have to stay as a medium-sized creature, but I can take anybody's... face. And... Yeah. Um... Yeah, I have to stay as a medium-sized creature. I have some wiggle room with height, but I can't be tiny, and I can't be massive. 
SPEAKER2 0:40:46
and I can't be massive. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:48
Look like another Kenku. That'd make it easier. 
SPEAKER4 0:40:53
And how are we going to explain that I'm... gone? 
SPEAKER1 0:40:59
Crawled in the bag. Just crawl in the damn bag. 
SPEAKER4 0:41:02
Okay, I'm going to make myself look like a Kenku and crawl into the bag. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:07
Why would you go change as a Kenku? No, no. I meant crawl in the bag as normally. 
SPEAKER2 0:41:12
Okay, alright. 
SPEAKER4 0:41:14
I un-Kenkoo'd myself. 
SPEAKER3 0:41:16
You're gonna un-Kenkoo yourself. 
SPEAKER4 0:41:18
I don't know what this plan is, but I guess we're going with it. Are you a Kenku or not? I am not a Kenku. Okay, what are you? I'm the, uh, rogue elf person whose face I stole a couple weeks ago at this point. 
SPEAKER2 0:41:35
So you just crawled into the bag, changed, changed again, and then just peeked your little owl? 
SPEAKER3 0:41:41
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:44
Um, we really gotta figure you out. You've got some problems. 
SPEAKER4 0:41:49
You told me that you would- I'm in the bag. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:54
Don't eat anything in there, it might kill us. 
SPEAKER4 0:41:57
I have no intention to eat anything in here. It's probably all going to be horrific poison, all those mind flayer things. 
SPEAKER1 0:42:05
Grab one of the potions, if you can, to replenish the one I took from you before. 
SPEAKER4 0:42:11
Uh, alright. 
SPEAKER1 0:42:14
Anyways, I'm ready. We can wait or go. Your call. 
SPEAKER2 0:42:19
If you're... quite ready... I can proceed. If you're ready with magic items and preparations, anything you must do. 
SPEAKER4 0:42:32
You're gonna be glaring at this guy out of the lip of the bag like some sort of disturbed cat. 
SPEAKER1 0:42:37
Hehehehehe. Oh, since I didn't get to change, I gotta change a few things, if you don't mind. 
SPEAKER3 0:42:47
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:42:48
Uh, you guys can continue around. Yeah. I'll be alright. 
SPEAKER3 0:42:54
I need a marching order, please time me down first. Please don't. 
SPEAKER2 0:43:01
Mechie. Cause I don't want anybody to just butt in my face. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:43:06
Who's after me? 
SPEAKER2 0:43:08
What's going down? 
SPEAKER3 0:43:11
Alright. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:13
In Songhan, we'll go next. After Ord. 
SPEAKER2 0:43:16
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:23
So, in Songhan, after Ord, then after you, all the rest of the soldiers begin playing their way down as well. Thankfully, you've done this descent once before. So, while it's not remarkable, perhaps, you do know where your good footholds are, and where your not-so-good footholds are as well. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:45
Ahem. 
SPEAKER5 0:43:46
Hm. Ahem. 
SPEAKER2 0:43:49
Ahem. 
SPEAKER5 0:43:50
Ahem. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:51
What the heck? 
SPEAKER1 0:43:53
Ahem. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:54
Anyway. 
SPEAKER2 0:43:56
Sorry. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:59
My lungs did not be liquid anymore. Okay, we're good. 
SPEAKER2 0:44:03
So. This... 
SPEAKER3 0:44:05
Well, it started as a seven-hour descent of slow exploration. Are you trying to go down this cave space quickly, or are you just... Are you more stealthy? That's the other question I'm going to have to ask. 
SPEAKER4 0:44:20
I mean, I would vote stealthy, but I'm in a bag right now, so I don't think I have a say in that front. Nope. 
SPEAKER2 0:44:30
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 0:44:31
Uh... Okay. No, no, no. Ord's just a-going. In Songhan, would the... 
SPEAKER4 0:44:36
Not in Songhan. 
SPEAKER1 0:44:37
In Songhan, would the... Not in Snitching. Sorry. 
SPEAKER5 0:44:40
I think there you have it. Michi's gonna try to be stealthy as she's walking in the front. 
SPEAKER1 0:44:42
But... I'm gonna keep casting Guidance on myself as I do. Okay. So you're going... 
SPEAKER2 0:44:46
So you guys are going at stealth, right? You're going at 5.52... 
SPEAKER5 0:44:48
You got a minute. 
SPEAKER2 0:44:49
Shut up. 
SPEAKER1 0:44:50
Wait, what? 5.52. Oh. Oh. 
SPEAKER5 0:44:54
Oh. Oh. Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:44:57
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 0:44:58
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:44:59
Oh. Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:45:01
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. 
SPEAKER5 0:45:05
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:45:06
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:07
Oh. 
SPEAKER4 0:45:08
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 0:45:09
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:45:10
Oh. 
SPEAKER5 0:45:11
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:45:15
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:16
Ugh! 
SPEAKER1 0:45:18
All of them... Fled. FLED! 
SPEAKER5 0:45:21
FLED! ai... 
SPEAKER3 0:45:23
What? Eye of Dead Moon at Lost John... 
SPEAKER1 0:45:25
What? 
SPEAKER3 0:45:26
Fall? Fall. I don't know what happened... But! 
SPEAKER1 0:45:30
We're gonna continue. Since you guys are going anywhere... 
SPEAKER5 0:45:32
Wait. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:33
Are you talking about me? 
SPEAKER1 0:45:34
Oh God... 
SPEAKER3 0:45:35
Kay... 
SPEAKER1 0:45:36
C'mon. 
SPEAKER2 0:45:37
Nevermind, we're just chugging it. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:39
Okay, so y'all are booking it down. Because you don't have to do any sort of cave exploration, instead of the seven hour long set, make it down on the better part of four hours. Okay, good to face you guys. 
SPEAKER2 0:45:59
Finally. 
SPEAKER5 0:46:01
Took forever. 
SPEAKER2 0:46:04
Oh, really? Really? Surprise, okay. That's your second crybaby point. Sounds like a lot of yapping. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:19
I do a lot of yapping. 
SPEAKER1 0:46:23
Occasionally. Don't you like being like a DM then? 
SPEAKER5 0:46:33
I don't know, keep going. 
SPEAKER1 0:46:35
Keep going. 
SPEAKER2 0:46:36
Keep going. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:37
Keep saying shit. 
SPEAKER2 0:46:45
I said it. I'm gonna keep it down on this. Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:46:56
I'm gonna be into you people. 
SPEAKER2 0:46:58
I mean exactly that. 
SPEAKER5 0:47:05
Yeah, I'm gonna keep it down on this. 
SPEAKER2 0:47:06
I don't have a specific planet prosperous, but that's when the ideas in this is the 
SPEAKER5 0:47:17
consciousness that. It's not my God. 
SPEAKER2 0:47:19
Hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:47:20
Call Wily with lightly, 
SPEAKER2 0:47:30
Meechie, you have 300 feet of interesting darkvision, don't you? No, I have more than that. Jesus. Okay. It's like on the upside of 400 and something. 
SPEAKER3 0:47:42
Good to know. Forest, what form are you in right now? 
SPEAKER4 0:47:45
I'm in the elf person. 
SPEAKER3 0:47:48
Okay. Okay. What's the start of darkvision? 
SPEAKER4 0:47:51
Elf darkvision? Elf darkvision. Elf darkvision. I don't know what the- I think it's 35 feet? I should have this written down, but I don't. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:01
How do you not have this written down? 
SPEAKER4 0:48:03
Well, I steal it off Facebook, but it's... You know, I can't just constantly remember everybody's- all the- everything's. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:12
Memorize every race's stat block, thank you. 
SPEAKER2 0:48:19
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:21
And then I need a token, or... 
SPEAKER1 0:48:23
Let's go to the lab. 
SPEAKER4 0:48:28
It's not my fault that I can switch who I am at any given moment. I was made this way. I- You made me a science experiment. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:39
Very true. 
SPEAKER2 0:48:42
I'm just sayin'. 
SPEAKER5 0:48:58
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:49:04
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:49:15
Okay. Everyone is on the map, right? Can everyone see? 
SPEAKER2 0:49:20
Yeah. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:49:23
Yes. 
SPEAKER2 0:49:25
Very true. 
SPEAKER4 0:49:26
Oh. That's a weird shape of a thing. 
SPEAKER3 0:49:30
You find yourselves in the back of the bottom category of the- uh, the bottom of the descent. I am just putting one guard token down for right now. That will represent the firms that you have been using all the rest of the fall. 
SPEAKER4 0:49:44
How many are there? Total? 
SPEAKER3 0:49:47
Seven, if you're including any of them in the account. 
SPEAKER4 0:49:50
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:49:57
So, who's taking the beating? Who's going where? 
SPEAKER4 0:50:07
I'm getting out of the bag. And I'm attempting to hide again, not, uh, just to be stealthy and not get eaten. 
SPEAKER3 0:50:16
Good. Make a stealth check. 
SPEAKER2 0:50:18
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:50:21
Twenty-five. 
SPEAKER2 0:50:24
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:50:25
You feel very hidden. As you do so, the instructions say, if you don't have your weapons, be ready for them. 
SPEAKER5 0:50:34
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:50:35
The rest of you can't even keep up. 
SPEAKER2 0:50:38
Do, uh, be mindful. There's these little floating pancake creatures. They're actually non-hostile. Don't, don't hurt them. Please. They have saved our lives. 
SPEAKER3 0:50:55
Okay. Don't attack anything that looks like any... Oh, excuse me. Floating pancake. 
SPEAKER2 0:51:02
Sounds like farts. You'll be fine. 
SPEAKER3 0:51:04
Uh, what? 
SPEAKER1 0:51:05
It... If it sounds like it's farting, you should be okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:51:09
Okay. Well, lead on. 
SPEAKER2 0:51:14
Uh... Anybody want to... take the lead on this one? Or shall I just mosey on the way we came? 
SPEAKER1 0:51:23
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:51:25
I can, but you must follow behind quietly. 
SPEAKER2 0:51:33
Very well. 
SPEAKER4 0:51:39
I'm gonna start off down the... cavern. 
SPEAKER2 0:51:43
Are you going the way we did before, like this direction? 
SPEAKER1 0:51:47
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 0:51:48
Gotcha. 
SPEAKER1 0:51:49
Oh. As we go, couldn't Songhan try to keep an eye out to see if the flumps are anywhere around? Like, he's, he's particularly trying to look out for them. 
SPEAKER2 0:51:58
Sure. 
SPEAKER3 0:52:00
I'll make a perception check when you guys get to that area. 
SPEAKER2 0:52:03
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:52:04
How far is it you're having him get to move your character? 
SPEAKER4 0:52:07
Um... I can't figure out which one's me. 
SPEAKER2 0:52:12
The one that looks like a changeling. 
SPEAKER4 0:52:14
Ah, yes. Okay, there we go. You know, if he collides with a wall. Why am I colliding with a wall? 
SPEAKER2 0:52:20
Sorry. The way the maps are imported... 
SPEAKER3 0:52:22
You can either choose basically how close to real you want your wall behavior to be. So... Hmm. 
SPEAKER5 0:52:36
Something seems different here. 
SPEAKER2 0:52:40
This doesn't look right, Forrest. I keep colliding with walls. 
SPEAKER4 0:52:46
This... doesn't look right. I'm not sure. 
SPEAKER5 0:52:50
I'm not sure. 
SPEAKER1 0:52:51
This... cave is entirely different than last time. 
SPEAKER4 0:52:55
I... yes it is. 
SPEAKER2 0:52:58
I'm looking at... GM. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:04
I don't know what you're saying. 
SPEAKER1 0:53:05
It looks like the same cave, it just looks like the color's gone. No, you added more details. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:10
It's part of Dark Vision, I think. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:12
It's part of Dark Vision. The cave is the same. GM to players, the cave is the same. 
SPEAKER1 0:53:18
It's on hard. I swear to god. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:20
Yeah, it's pretty. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:21
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:22
Alright, I'm scooting along. Trying to not collide with walls. 
SPEAKER1 0:53:28
Alright, I wasn't dropped in the main part of the cave. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:31
Oh, you were. 
SPEAKER1 0:53:32
I can see everything. My third eye just opened. The fucking bird's third eye opened. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:40
You do hear the flumps off in the distance. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:43
And you see at least one eye kind of poke out between the cracks. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:48
But as it sees the rest of your group, especially the guards, it hides itself again. 
SPEAKER1 0:53:56
Where's the eye coming up from? 
SPEAKER3 0:53:58
Right about here. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:01
Oh my god. What have I done? 
SPEAKER3 0:54:06
What have I done? I'm measuring. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:12
The bird is dead yet again. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:14
Right here. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:16
Can Stonkon try to kind of like step back and like kind of wave it towards them? 
SPEAKER2 0:54:23
Make a persuasion check. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:25
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:26
The rest of the guards begin to squeeze the cavern as you reach out close. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:34
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:35
It's going to basically bob in the air at you and then retreat backwards. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:43
Stonkon is sad. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:46
But, yeah. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:48
So, the guards continue forward. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:53
Ford, are you continuing forward as well? 
SPEAKER2 0:55:02
Yes. 
SPEAKER5 0:55:03
But... So, you continue on with this. Okay. So, you're going to go to the back. You're going to go to the back. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:13
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:55:14
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:15
Or is it you around the next corner? 
SPEAKER3 0:55:18
You do also find more blocks that are just kind of floating highly. They do watch you as you pass through, but they don't make too much of an attempt at contact. 
SPEAKER4 0:55:31
I'm going to give them a small wave and keep on not colliding with the walls. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:36
One of them does wave back at you. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:39
Cool. Wait, Isan's going to slip off his ring for a second and try to reach out to them mentally. Like, thinking of their intentions. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:52
You get a response. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:56
What do they say? 
SPEAKER3 0:55:58
Oh, crap. I'm back. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:02
Isan will think back about their intentions to explore the cave and how they're trying to get out of the cave. They're trying to get out of the cave. They're trying to help get rid of whatever threat is here. And they have people to help. 
SPEAKER2 0:56:17
And it's just a... 
SPEAKER1 0:56:21
They desperately need 
SPEAKER2 0:56:22
to make this work. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:25
And this is a very, very important thing. And any help would be appreciated. 
SPEAKER3 0:56:32
Make another persuasion check. It would be interesting. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:39
Persuasion. 
SPEAKER3 0:56:43
I'm trying to remember how to... 
SPEAKER1 0:56:49
Oh, forget it. I'm just going to roll twice. 
SPEAKER5 0:56:50
Just to... 
SPEAKER2 0:56:55
Dang. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:56
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:56:58
Alright. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:59
Eleven is higher than ten. Yeah. You're not wrong. Alright. Alright. Are they persuaded? Was I... Was I incredibly convincing? 
SPEAKER3 0:57:18
At eleven. Get the feeling, right? 
SPEAKER1 0:57:22
I cannot follow. 
SPEAKER3 0:57:24
How I look. And you do get flashes and images 
SPEAKER2 0:57:27
thrust into your head. 
SPEAKER3 0:57:31
The images are people. People shaped objects. 
SPEAKER2 0:57:35
The satins being dragged 
SPEAKER3 0:57:36
to different parts of the cave. You get an image of a tall pig dressed in these dark robes. 
SPEAKER5 0:57:42
It's like, 
SPEAKER3 0:57:43
skin is sickly purple. It's long, long fingers. The head itself is bald and oblong. There are chemicals on it. The images that you see, there are two, three of them 
SPEAKER2 0:57:56
possibly. 
SPEAKER1 0:57:59
Of the tentacle dudes? 
SPEAKER3 0:58:03
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:04
Oh, wonderful. And so they're like watching over these shapes that are basically like people being dragged. Okay. 100%. 
SPEAKER3 0:58:39
It's not really giving you 
SPEAKER2 0:58:41
a sense of time. 
SPEAKER3 0:58:43
There is no day or life down this gate. Everything is fresh. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:52
As I see these images, I'm going to kind of 
SPEAKER3 0:58:57
wonder. 
SPEAKER1 0:59:01
I'm going to wonder about the children and the professor that we're searching for. 
SPEAKER2 0:59:10
You know, 
SPEAKER1 0:59:12
like, you know, 
SPEAKER3 0:59:13
you do get that word distance, okay? Not great history, 
SPEAKER2 0:59:18
but distance. Screams of children. 
SPEAKER1 0:59:25
It's not ominous at all. Anything about, like, 
SPEAKER5 0:59:28
the professor? 
SPEAKER1 0:59:30
Like, anything that would indicate anything about him? 
SPEAKER3 0:59:33
This one gives you curiosity. 
SPEAKER2 0:59:37
Investigation. 
SPEAKER1 0:59:38
Nothing. 
SPEAKER3 0:59:40
You can't tell if it's giving you those thoughts. Because those are the thoughts that read off the professor. Or because those are the thoughts that catch the voice of the professor. 
SPEAKER1 0:59:49
Okay. Um, wait, where is everyone else? Did everyone else move onward as they saw God was doing? 
SPEAKER3 0:59:58
I'm assuming that no one else said they were stopping and everyone else is moving forward. 
SPEAKER1 1:00:02
Lord is still right here. Oh, fuck, he just nipped away. 
SPEAKER3 1:00:08
That is me moving forward, sorry. 
SPEAKER1 1:00:10
Oh, okay. Um, um, Insunghan will quickly kind of thank the flump, like, um, kind of nodding his head at it, uh, and run to catch up with the group. 
SPEAKER2 1:00:25
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:00:26
And he's going to tug on, like, the first person he sees and kind of indicate to them, I see there's a flump right here, too. He's gonna kind of point to the flump, then indicate with his ring, like, a pulling off the ring, a ring motion. He's gonna put his ring back on, pull it off, and point to the flump, hoping that, I'm guessing it's Ord, who he's, like, 
SPEAKER3 1:00:50
you know, 
SPEAKER1 1:00:51
reached for. 
SPEAKER3 1:00:52
I believe you were the last person. No, I think you were the second person to march forward. 
SPEAKER1 1:00:55
You're following back 
SPEAKER3 1:00:56
to the back of this, 
SPEAKER1 1:00:57
uh, 
SPEAKER3 1:00:58
this gaggle of people. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:01
No, no. Ord's sticking up in your front. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:04
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:04
Okay. Which player would be 
SPEAKER3 1:01:07
towards the ring? 
SPEAKER1 1:01:10
Not me. 
SPEAKER5 1:01:11
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:13
I guess I just leaves me then. Somehow. 
SPEAKER2 1:01:17
I'm not sure. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:17
But, yeah, I guess. 
SPEAKER4 1:01:18
I thought, I thought Michi was second. 
SPEAKER2 1:01:20
I thought... 
SPEAKER1 1:01:21
Yeah. Um, wouldn't that mean, like, the group of soldiers and whatnot that we're leading down? 
SPEAKER2 1:01:26
That would be... Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:30
So he just goes up to some dude, uh, and hopes that this guy gets the message and will try to communicate 
SPEAKER3 1:01:38
with the flump. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:38
And Isonghan is also hoping, like, um, you know, his mind is obviously hoping that the flumps will convey 
SPEAKER2 1:01:49
the same message 
SPEAKER1 1:01:50
to this guy. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:54
So, 
SPEAKER1 1:01:57
you pull on, kind of, 
SPEAKER3 1:01:58
the armor of the 
SPEAKER2 1:01:58
of the last guard 
SPEAKER3 1:02:00
in the group. 
SPEAKER2 1:02:02
This one being the one who Forrest had noticed, 
SPEAKER3 1:02:05
noted earlier, 
SPEAKER2 1:02:06
um, does not bear any physical weapons outside of one very small dagger. Um, but you notice, and you point over at the flump, this one he was wearing, I believe, if I am correct, this being the one donned with the cowboy cap. 
SPEAKER1 1:02:25
ALF! 
SPEAKER2 1:02:27
You indicate over the cap. The elf kind of bobs forward 
SPEAKER3 1:02:32
to and towards you, and looks at the soldier. 
SPEAKER2 1:02:35
How do you convey 
SPEAKER3 1:02:38
what you're trying to convey 
SPEAKER2 1:02:39
to the soldier? 
SPEAKER5 1:02:40
Okay, so Isonghan is like, I'm not sure what I'm doing, 
SPEAKER1 1:02:42
but I'm just trying to make sure that you're not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to make sure that you're not doing anything wrong. Isonghan will, um, show that he pulled off his ring. He's going to hold up his hand 
SPEAKER2 1:02:50
and hold up the ring 
SPEAKER1 1:02:51
and kind of motion like a pulling off motion. Um, and then point to the flump and then point to his head. 
SPEAKER2 1:02:59
Do... I'm sorry, little bird, 
SPEAKER5 1:03:02
but I don't understand what you're saying. 
SPEAKER2 1:03:04
Isonghan's going to put it on my head? 
SPEAKER3 1:03:05
Isonghan's going to 
SPEAKER1 1:03:06
put it on my head? 
SPEAKER3 1:03:07
Isonghan's going to 
SPEAKER2 1:03:08
put it on my head? Isonghan's going to You're going to put it on my head? Isonghan's going to keep a grip on this guy 
SPEAKER1 1:03:14
because he really doesn't want him to leave and he's going to, um, um, pull out his flashcards and, uh, find the words hawk, pancake, no ring. 
SPEAKER5 1:03:34
Safe. 
SPEAKER3 1:03:40
Is at this point, is this the end that the figure looks at Alph and says, Hello, strange pancake. 
SPEAKER2 1:03:53
Isonghan's going to like, 
SPEAKER1 1:03:55
Isonghan's going to shove his hand in the air kind of like closer to this guy's face and like hold the ring separate to show like he's not wearing the ring. He looks at you and says, 
SPEAKER3 1:04:07
I don't have one of those. 
SPEAKER1 1:04:09
Oh, Isonghan's going to pull his hands back and be like slightly awkward. 
SPEAKER2 1:04:17
I apologize. 
SPEAKER3 1:04:18
I didn't mean to offend. 
SPEAKER1 1:04:25
The only thing Isonghan wants now 
SPEAKER2 1:04:27
is for Alph to just tell this guy 
SPEAKER1 1:04:28
what's up. The same things that flashed 
SPEAKER2 1:04:31
through Isonghan's mind. 
SPEAKER3 1:04:35
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:04:36
So now how are you going to 
SPEAKER3 1:04:37
persuade Alph to do that? 
SPEAKER1 1:04:39
Um, I'd say, Isonghan will basically just think like, please tell him what was told to me. This is really important. I can't tell them. I can't warn the others. Please just help me. 
SPEAKER3 1:04:56
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:04:59
Okay. Uh. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:05:09
Lifeline doesn't want it. Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:05:12
Okay. I'll just go to kind of bottom here and switch this one of its eye stocks 
SPEAKER3 1:05:17
over to this other finger and try and reach out. 
SPEAKER5 1:05:24
Yes. Let's see if I'm getting 
SPEAKER3 1:05:27
nosob GTA games. So let me get some dice from here. I stocks. 
SPEAKER4 1:05:31
Are they like floating pancake snails? 
SPEAKER3 1:05:35
Essentially? 
SPEAKER2 1:05:36
Yeah, 
SPEAKER1 1:05:37
we have kings and all. 
SPEAKER3 1:05:38
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 1:05:38
Wait, 
SPEAKER1 1:05:38
Max King was Have you seen the pictures of them, Natalia? 
SPEAKER4 1:05:44
I'm sure- I remember- ow. I don't remember seeing a picture. Is it in the art channel? 
SPEAKER1 1:05:48
Yeah, go to the character art. They're actually so cute! 
SPEAKER4 1:05:52
They are pancake snails. 
SPEAKER1 1:05:54
They're just little guys. 
SPEAKER4 1:05:56
Why is that one a priest? 
SPEAKER2 1:05:58
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 1:06:00
Oh. It's the pope, actually. 
SPEAKER4 1:06:03
Sorry, why is that one the pope? 
SPEAKER1 1:06:05
I don't know. Would you go up to the pope and ask him why he's the pope? 
SPEAKER4 1:06:09
I don't know, that seems- 
SPEAKER1 1:06:11
That seems kind of insensitive. 
SPEAKER2 1:06:13
This tells me you guys have never watched Futurama. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:17
Oh! I've watched Futurama but it's been so fucking long. 
SPEAKER2 1:06:21
It's supposed to be Space Pope. Like Giant Flying Spaghetti Monster. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:23
Ah, nice. I haven't seen that show in so long. This is what Scientologists believe in. 
SPEAKER4 1:06:31
I believe in it. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:33
I did not say they wanted no pancakes. 
SPEAKER3 1:06:35
I didn't ask them to make a song, so I gave them. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:37
That is not what I said. 
SPEAKER4 1:06:39
What? 
SPEAKER3 1:06:41
I... Okay, I heard that. Do not misquote me. I fucking... 
SPEAKER4 1:06:45
That is what you said. I did not say that. You did cut out, but that is what you said. 
SPEAKER3 1:06:51
Oh, I cut out? 
SPEAKER1 1:06:55
No, I honestly, legit, I think that is what you said. 
SPEAKER2 1:06:59
Okay. Okay. Don't worry about it. 
SPEAKER1 1:07:03
Yeah, he's... Yeah. I think it makes sense and half, but that's what you said. 
SPEAKER2 1:07:07
Anyway. Alf conveys some level of information over to the guard in front of him. 
SPEAKER3 1:07:15
You're not sure exactly in front of him. He proceeds to try and make his way to the front of the group. However, I do believe, are the rest of you guys still moving? Uh, I was. I was still sneaking off. And Forrest, you are looking right down the corridor that leads... 
SPEAKER2 1:07:25
That descent. 
SPEAKER4 1:07:27
Yeah. I'm not sure if you can see it. 
SPEAKER3 1:07:31
I can't see it. I'm not sure where that leads. That descent. 
SPEAKER4 1:07:37
Off we go! Still sneaking. 
SPEAKER1 1:07:41
Does this guy make it? Like, does he... 
SPEAKER3 1:07:43
You do see him make it up to the front, and then say, 
SPEAKER1 1:07:47
Okay. Isan will also be, like, running up, so can he, like... Can he hear... Um... Will he, like, tell us the rest of the group? 
SPEAKER3 1:07:57
Yes. You can hear that he tells the group. 
SPEAKER2 1:07:59
Uh, sir, it seems like... You... You're starting to be... 
SPEAKER3 1:08:05
You may be doing more headings. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:07
Like, just a one or two. 
SPEAKER5 1:08:09
It's what you had to say. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:11
It's what you had to say. It's what you had to say. It's what our companions are worth themselves. 
SPEAKER3 1:08:17
It's what our companions are worth themselves. 
SPEAKER1 1:08:19
Isan is going to tug on the armor Isan is going to tug on the armor of the main guy. Yes. And hold up, like, he's gonna hold up six fingers. And hold up, like, he's gonna hold up six fingers. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:31
Six. 
SPEAKER5 1:08:33
As in the number we are rescuing 
SPEAKER3 1:08:35
As in the number we are rescuing 
SPEAKER2 1:08:37
or the number we are fixing? 
SPEAKER1 1:08:39
Uh... Isagan's gonna... hold up, uh... kind of like, his hands, like... kind of like, his hands, like... together, like, palms facing each other. together, like, palms facing each other. Or fists. He's gonna do, like, hands. Like, punching hands. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:59
You're gonna fight six, so it's great. You're gonna fight six, so it's great. Say it again, Spiderman. He then pulls someone else aside and says, 
SPEAKER5 1:09:11
He then pulls someone else aside and says, 
SPEAKER2 1:09:13
I'm going to put you here. 
SPEAKER5 1:09:15
I'm going to put you here. 
SPEAKER2 1:09:17
In fact, you know, 
SPEAKER3 1:09:19
there's a better way to do this. You and you, he selects two of the pike 
SPEAKER2 1:09:23
he selects two of the pike 
SPEAKER3 1:09:25
and says, both of you are to watch this thing and says, both of you are to watch this thing 
SPEAKER2 1:09:29
if anything else should come through if anything else should come through the front of the tunnels, 
SPEAKER3 1:09:33
one of you is to come and alert us. 
SPEAKER2 1:09:35
We can't get flanked in the rear. If we are not back within an hour, one of you will be sent to alert the rest of the guard to be in a large area. That more supposedly understood? Both of them nod, and they take up positions at that cart at the top of the entrance. at that cart at the top of the entrance. The rest of the guard says, The rest of the guard says, Are you all ready? Are you all ready? 
SPEAKER5 1:10:05
Isangan will just look back at him, 
SPEAKER1 1:10:07
Isangan will just look back at him, very anxious, and visibly, very anxious, and visibly, probably not ready, but he'll do his best. 
SPEAKER3 1:10:17
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:10:19
Leeroy Jenkins. Leeroy Jenkins. 
SPEAKER3 1:10:23
Can I do that? Thank you. I'm glad I did. 
SPEAKER2 1:10:27
Thank you. I'm glad I did. 
SPEAKER1 1:10:29
Heard you say, It's alright. We only need to worry if they're the big old rock creatures. The other things in here are softer than berries 
SPEAKER2 1:10:41
from a bush. 
SPEAKER1 1:10:43
Isangan will just look at Ord like, the fuck did you just say 
SPEAKER2 1:10:47
type of look. I think we, uh, 
SPEAKER3 1:10:53
I think we've killed 
SPEAKER1 1:10:55
I think we've killed probably their whole entire hive, but let's not cuss any fingers. 
SPEAKER2 1:11:01
but let's not cuss any fingers. 
SPEAKER5 1:11:03
but let's not cuss any fingers. 
SPEAKER1 1:11:05
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:11:07
Do you begin your descent down to the lower level? 
SPEAKER5 1:11:09
Uh. 
SPEAKER1 1:11:11
Uh. Who's leading the charge in that case? 
SPEAKER4 1:11:15
I am not leading the charge into battle. I am not leading the charge into battle. Sorry, but I am going to stay back and smite people from the rear. 
SPEAKER5 1:11:23
Hm. 
SPEAKER1 1:11:25
Good idea. Well. Isangan will stay by fours. Isangan will stay by fours. 
SPEAKER2 1:11:31
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:11:33
Isangan will stay by fours. Michi, you take the rear, after that. 
SPEAKER1 1:11:39
No. You know what, Ord? I think you've got a hot enough head. Do you think? How about you lead the way this time? 
SPEAKER2 1:11:51
I suppose I could. 
SPEAKER1 1:11:53
I suppose I could. Don't worry. I won't let you die again. 
SPEAKER2 1:11:57
Well. 
SPEAKER1 1:11:59
Yeah, that wasn't my fault, though. Anyways. Farewell. Anyways. Farewell. 
SPEAKER2 1:12:05
Anyways. Farewell. 
SPEAKER3 1:12:09
Okay. I'm going to set up the next map now. That's forward. 
SPEAKER1 1:12:15
I'm going to be kind of parallel to Ord. I'm going to be kind of parallel to Ord. 
SPEAKER2 1:12:19
If there's a possibility of that. Okay. Like, slightly behind. I'm staggered almost. And then behind you will be Isangan and then behind them, fours. 
SPEAKER3 1:12:27
And then behind you will be Isangan and then behind them, fours. Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:12:31
I'm gonna go ahead and preemptively Yeah. I'm gonna go ahead and preemptively cast Guidance on Ord, just in case we have anything around this damn corner. 
SPEAKER2 1:12:39
We're gonna not just sit back here and try and look. 
SPEAKER4 1:12:41
We're gonna not just sit back here and try and look. We're gonna not just sit back here and try and look. I want to creep forward a little bit, but I don't want to be at the front 
SPEAKER2 1:12:49
where I can be easily consumed. 
SPEAKER5 1:12:51
... 
SPEAKER3 1:12:53
... Um, yes. I agree with that one. 
SPEAKER4 1:12:59
Cause I have, um, since I have the alert feat, I'm probably gonna notice anything before anybody else does, so I want to be able to shoot it first. 
SPEAKER5 1:13:07
... 
SPEAKER2 1:13:09
... 
SPEAKER4 1:13:11
... ... ... 
SPEAKER3 1:13:17
... ... 
SPEAKER2 1:13:21
... I apologize. I said it, but... 
SPEAKER3 1:13:31
Hold some things. 
SPEAKER1 1:13:34
Word you may add. 
SPEAKER2 1:13:36
One four to any ability check you take. 
SPEAKER1 1:13:41
One. He can do it. He has plus four to whatever his ability check is. I cast a guidance on him. Thank you. Yes. Don't get diddled. 
SPEAKER3 1:14:01
I placeholder an inch real quick. Everyone take a two minute break real quick while I get the next two pages set up. 
SPEAKER1 1:14:08
Wow. 
SPEAKER3 1:14:11
Do you want the next two pages to run smoothly or not? 
SPEAKER4 1:14:14
You weren't prepared for unrestrained chaos? 
SPEAKER1 1:14:17
No, no. This was on the rails. This is completely the way we should have been. We've been actually... Pretty well behaved in this instance. 
SPEAKER3 1:14:25
Yes, actually. 
SPEAKER4 1:14:26
I haven't done anything insane yet. 
SPEAKER1 1:14:27
He has no excuses this time. 
SPEAKER4 1:14:30
Hunter hasn't, uh... Burned down a village. 
SPEAKER1 1:14:33
Well, sadly... 
SPEAKER2 1:14:36
That won't be happening for a while. 
SPEAKER4 1:14:41
I'm just saying, if Hunter hadn't decided to summon the lizard prophet... 
SPEAKER1 1:14:47
Now he's back out on the loose. 
SPEAKER2 1:14:48
Who knows what chaos he's actually doing. 
SPEAKER3 1:14:53
He might have his son and daughter. 
SPEAKER2 1:15:03
As far as you would know, yes. 
SPEAKER4 1:15:08
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:15:10
Better. 
SPEAKER1 1:15:10
May or may not change things. 
SPEAKER2 1:15:12
Wait. 
SPEAKER3 1:15:13
Didn't they declare Gizzard as the lizard prophet, though? 
SPEAKER5 1:15:17
No. Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:15:18
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:15:18
I thought that was the whole point of the bounty. There he goes. There he goes. There he goes. 
SPEAKER3 1:15:23
I need to get all of these turrets. 
SPEAKER2 1:15:25
Have some vision set up. I never... 
SPEAKER1 1:15:55
Few travelers that I came through never gave it a name. 
SPEAKER2 1:16:01
It's just my forest. Anything interesting about this forest? Or just... I've never been to many forests except for a few, but they usually were riddled. 
SPEAKER5 1:16:21
I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 1:16:23
Well, compared to many, this forest had many more of the smaller creatures. 
SPEAKER2 1:16:33
It was more peaceful than others. 
SPEAKER1 1:16:41
There were no great beasts that roamed and made us fearful to sleep at night or anything like that. Okay. We're back. 
SPEAKER2 1:16:54
Sorry. You're fine. 
SPEAKER3 1:16:57
So, Forth, you're peeking over. Are you descending? 
SPEAKER5 1:17:01
With. 
SPEAKER4 1:17:03
I just want to stay towards the back so I'm not, like, out front as the primary target. 
SPEAKER3 1:17:08
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:09
So you all do descend, then. 
SPEAKER3 1:17:11
And go next to the boat. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:13
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 1:17:14
It's probably a really stupid decision, but yes. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:16
So that's where we come from. 
SPEAKER5 1:17:18
Yeah. I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm not sure what you're talking about. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:22
It's definitely walking around there. 
SPEAKER3 1:17:23
So that's where we can go around. 
SPEAKER4 1:17:24
These things just eat us, so. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:25
Well. 
SPEAKER4 1:17:26
It's definitely not smart. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:28
We could have put the bird Feels like a bird on a string and dangling it like bait. I mean. Let's go fishing with the bard. Sounds like a great plan. 
SPEAKER4 1:17:35
Wait. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:36
Does Michi sing that they'll put? 
SPEAKER4 1:17:37
Or is that out of character? 
SPEAKER1 1:17:38
If Michi's gonna say it, if the bird doesn't sing, then I guess that's the alternate plan. They gotta give you a stern-ass look. I don't know Strange, but I don't know what they're saying. 
SPEAKER3 1:17:41
I don't know Strange. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:42
I don't know Strange. I don't know Strange. I don't know Strange. I don't know Strange. I don't know Strange. This, like. Looking at the fucking whatever loop instrument you have out. Like. Kind of. 
SPEAKER1 1:17:59
Like. Mhm. That. Hmm! The whole fucking SpongeBob opening the refrigerator with all the shit in it. 
SPEAKER2 1:18:11
Ethan just like. 
SPEAKER1 1:18:16
Education. Just like. 
SPEAKER2 1:18:17
more open and much easier to traverse next to the center. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:22
Find yourself in a familiar place. This being as deep as you made it into the caves and also the near final resting place for your annual trip. And the actual final resting place for your two last masters. 
SPEAKER1 1:18:41
I can't see anything. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:44
Well, have you tried being better? 
SPEAKER2 1:18:48
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 1:18:50
Um, you could do. Huh. We're back where that thing died a little. Oh. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:02
Oh my god. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:03
Corpses. Now, are you guys proceeding stealthily or not? 
SPEAKER4 1:19:13
I am going stealthily. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:15
Make a stealth check for me. 
SPEAKER4 1:19:19
22. 
SPEAKER1 1:19:20
Is Togon- Is Togon would also be trying to be stealthy? 
SPEAKER3 1:19:23
Stealth check! 
SPEAKER1 1:19:25
Michi is gonna be like, 
SPEAKER5 1:19:27
Odd. 
SPEAKER1 1:19:28
Silence this time. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:30
Care. We don't need none too. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:35
It's kinda- 
SPEAKER1 1:19:36
Very well. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:40
Kinda- Right. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:43
Really? 
SPEAKER3 1:19:44
Michi, stealth check! 
SPEAKER4 1:19:46
Gonna get eaten. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:49
Yeah, I'm fuckin' dead. Michi does not do stealth well. 
SPEAKER1 1:19:51
I fucking knew it! God damn it, eight. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:55
Hey, that's still worth a set one. Two successes to- two successes to failures. 
SPEAKER1 1:20:02
Mm-hmm. Yeah, two heavy fucking plate wearers are just clunkin' around. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:09
Oh, the guards did bad as well. We did kind of put you guys in a good spot. 
SPEAKER4 1:20:12
We did kind of put you guys forward into the meat shields, cause you're clunky and armored, so maybe they'll only see you and ignore the sneaky guys in the back? 
SPEAKER1 1:20:22
Yeah, very well, that's true. 
SPEAKER2 1:20:25
Well. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:27
So. 
SPEAKER2 1:20:28
Begin your descent. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:29
Begin to kind of scout out the area right next to you. 
SPEAKER2 1:20:34
As you're- 
SPEAKER3 1:20:36
Let's see. As you are... Finishing this. One of the guards misses a handful. And you just hear, 
SPEAKER2 1:20:46
AHH! CLUNK! 
SPEAKER3 1:20:49
As he whiffs- whiffs everything, he just lands ass first on the ground. Armor and everything is rattling. The sound echoes down in his hybrids. 
SPEAKER4 1:21:00
Can I immediately shrink away from him to the other side of the cave? Yep, go ahead. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:04
Cool. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:05
It's on two. 
SPEAKER2 1:21:08
Ow. 
SPEAKER4 1:21:09
I'm gonna get eaten. I don't want to be in the radius of eating. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:13
As that echoes, there is a response. A building growling that comes from deep within the cave. Of course there is. 
SPEAKER5 1:21:25
Nice. Uh. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:29
Everyone make a perception check, please. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:31
Actually, board a Michi. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:32
Go ahead and make perception checks. 
SPEAKER4 1:21:34
Why is it always a perception check? 
SPEAKER1 1:21:37
Michi's gonna go, Oh shit. Here we go again. Sixteen. 
SPEAKER4 1:21:44
Bro, we got nine. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:45
That is a fifteen. 15. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:49
Board, you see it first. Michi, you spot it barely second. You spot one of those small ring- Which is peeking its front and front lobes out and around the corner. And just face up, see all of you. Before it shrinks back and runs back into the cave. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:08
We have no chance to do an action as it ditches? 
SPEAKER2 1:22:13
Uh, it's not an attack range, so you don't get an attack opportunity. I will, however, say, Because you've also lost your surprise round, I just need to escape. But, go ahead and everyone, I'm gonna have everyone go ahead and do their favorite thing. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:31
We did, hold on. Did, uh, Four's see this creature? Dammit. 
SPEAKER4 1:22:42
That wasn't far forward enough. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:44
Right? Yeah, I couldn't- 
SPEAKER2 1:22:46
Yeah, you guys are around the wall. 
SPEAKER4 1:22:47
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:48
What are we doing? You and your slinking about. I was like, she just proc'd a fucking opportunity attack though, she did. Dammit. We're rolling for initiative now. 
SPEAKER3 1:23:00
Uh, give me a sec, I'm adding everyone to the combat order. 
SPEAKER1 1:23:03
Oh fuck. 
SPEAKER4 1:23:06
Well guys, it was nice knowing you. 
SPEAKER1 1:23:11
I always wondered when a songhung might die. 
SPEAKER2 1:23:14
Hold on. Alright, I think I get to roll again. 
SPEAKER1 1:23:18
Oh yeah, also, I would have full hit points, right? His name is Wagger. Because we long rested. 
SPEAKER3 1:23:26
I'll have everyone go ahead and... 
SPEAKER2 1:23:29
Roll initiative. 
SPEAKER4 1:23:32
I think most of us have. 
SPEAKER1 1:23:34
Oh, wow. 
SPEAKER3 1:23:35
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 1:23:37
Nice job, guys. 
SPEAKER4 1:23:38
One second. 
SPEAKER3 1:23:39
I mean, the- 
SPEAKER1 1:23:40
38 initiative? 
SPEAKER4 1:23:41
For some- Yeah, I have a plus 19. 
SPEAKER2 1:23:47
But I had something that gives me a bonus initiative. 
SPEAKER1 1:23:49
Teacher, teacher she's cheating. 
SPEAKER2 1:23:53
Teacher, teacher fuck you. 
SPEAKER4 1:23:56
Go through the beats and stuff if you want. 
SPEAKER2 1:24:01
Yeah, I'm looking at this. 
SPEAKER3 1:24:02
Double check. 
SPEAKER1 1:24:03
Alright. 
SPEAKER4 1:24:06
I attempted to build this character to be very good at being sneaky and hitting things and doing a lot of damage in one turn. Unfortunately, it doesn't last. But when it happens, I can do a lot. 
SPEAKER3 1:24:22
When it happens, it's great. Anyway, Forrest, you are first up. Lord Michi, you get a couple of words to indicate that you guys are now in combat. 
SPEAKER1 1:24:32
I'm going to spot it. 
SPEAKER4 1:24:33
Creep forward a little bit. And see if I see anything. Do I see anything? Darn it. I'm going to hold my action to the second that I see something that looks evil. 
SPEAKER2 1:24:47
I'm going to shoot it in the face, or the face equivalent. 
SPEAKER1 1:24:51
Oh. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:24:56
You're holding your action to see if something comes for you guys? 
SPEAKER1 1:24:59
Alright. 
SPEAKER4 1:25:00
If something shows up that looks evil, I'm going to shoot it. 
SPEAKER3 1:25:02
Next up is going to be... The guard who is a badass and a patient. So he's going to go ahead and he's going to try and say, Are we doing things? Are we doing things? I assume we're doing things. 
SPEAKER1 1:25:19
Brain bastard. Kill it. 
SPEAKER3 1:25:21
He's going to try to step over. He's going to step back up. Kind of right behind you, Michi, up on your left. Pike red. In Songhan, you are now up. 
SPEAKER1 1:25:38
Okay. In Songhan, he hasn't even seen this, right? He's only seen people shouting and shit? 
SPEAKER4 1:25:45
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 1:25:47
He's going to kind of run to about here? Can he see it yet? Nope. That's cool. Let me see. He... Is going to... 
SPEAKER5 1:26:06
Do... 
SPEAKER3 1:26:08
As he'll do like a bardic inspiration on... 
SPEAKER5 1:26:14
Um... 
SPEAKER1 1:26:15
Um... 
SPEAKER3 1:26:16
Fours? 
SPEAKER2 1:26:19
Is it an AoE or is it just a single target? 
SPEAKER4 1:26:22
Are you attacking me? 
SPEAKER1 1:26:24
No, isn't bardic inspiration to help? Fuck. 
SPEAKER2 1:26:26
Yeah, but it's a... I'm pretty sure it's an area of effect, not just a localized. 
SPEAKER1 1:26:32
Um... I'm pretty sure it's... For a target. 
SPEAKER4 1:26:35
It just says the creature. 
SPEAKER1 1:26:37
It's like targeted. Oh, okay. Yeah, one creature. Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:26:44
Um... 
SPEAKER2 1:26:44
What do I do with that then? 
SPEAKER1 1:26:49
Uh, you can... Roll the bardic die and add it to an ability check. 
SPEAKER3 1:26:56
So it's like a D6... 
SPEAKER1 1:26:58
D6. 
SPEAKER4 1:26:59
It's a D8 hero. 
SPEAKER1 1:27:01
Oh. 
SPEAKER5 1:27:03
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 1:27:03
Oh, fuck. 
SPEAKER1 1:27:04
That's right. 
SPEAKER4 1:27:04
If something shows up, I can add a D8 to be able to hit it with this? 
SPEAKER3 1:27:07
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 1:27:08
Or saving throws. 
SPEAKER3 1:27:09
Can I add to make the damage? 
SPEAKER1 1:27:10

Okay, I'll add... I'll add a D4. Uh... Let me see. Slash... That... 
SPEAKER2 1:40:54
That's a four. That's an eight hit. 
SPEAKER1 1:40:56
Nope. No, no. 
SPEAKER5 1:40:58
The four is already attached to you. Alright. 
SPEAKER1 1:41:00
That's okay. Oh, the four is already attached? Yeah, I roll for the four. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:03
And then you get what I... 
SPEAKER1 1:41:04
I rolled. 
SPEAKER2 1:41:05
Okay. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER5 1:41:07
Okay, then go ahead and roll a D4. I already did. 
SPEAKER1 1:41:09
Look in the chat.

Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:41:14
I'm gonna roll a D4. 
SPEAKER2 1:41:15
It's way up there. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:16
No, you don't roll a D4 once and then apply that. 
SPEAKER5 1:41:21
You... 
SPEAKER3 1:41:22
For guidance? 
SPEAKER2 1:41:23
No, it's a... 
SPEAKER3 1:41:24
It's a... Whatever they make the check for guidance, they roll an additional D4. 
SPEAKER5 1:41:30
So you can't preempt your... 
SPEAKER2 1:41:32
That is unfortunately true. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:33
No, you cannot preempt your legal guidance. 
SPEAKER5 1:41:36
It says once before... 
SPEAKER1 1:41:38
You touch... 
SPEAKER2 1:41:39
You touch a creature willing once before its spell ends, the target can roll... Oh, so they get to roll an MR. Whatever. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:44
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:41:45
Well, you fucking failed. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:46
But that's okay.

SPEAKER5 1:41:51
Oh, boy. Oh, no. You want to roll again? 
SPEAKER3 1:41:54
You want to roll again? 
SPEAKER2 1:41:55
Oh, no. 
SPEAKER1 1:41:56
I roll again? You've already used the guidance. It's still holding it. No. 
SPEAKER2 1:42:00
Oh, wait. It has to be another fucking round before that'd be active, right? 
SPEAKER1 1:42:02
Uh-huh. Well... 
SPEAKER3 1:42:04
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:42:05
What... 
SPEAKER1 1:42:06

SPEAKER2 1:42:07
What's the... What's the... What's the... What's the... What's the... 
SPEAKER1 1:42:12
What's the... What's the... What... What bullshit do I have that'll get me out of this? 
SPEAKER5 1:42:20
Um... 
SPEAKER2 1:42:21
Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER1 1:42:22
I have advantage on intelligence, wisdom, and charisma saving throws. Well... Yeah. Um... 
SPEAKER3 1:42:30
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:42:31
So, Ory's gonna... Ory's gonna... I guess he's gonna rage. He's gonna... He's gonna flip his shit, sprint up, and... And... Take one slice of that. And... And... 
SPEAKER2 1:42:42
And... 
SPEAKER1 1:42:43
And...  
SPEAKER3 1:43:05
Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER5 1:43:06
Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER3 1:43:07
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 1:43:08
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:43:09
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 1:43:10
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:43:11
Uh. 
SPEAKER2 1:43:12
of where this first beast is holding on to but the second one that you can see here is on and then this uses some other raised platform at the bottom so both of them also have been heightened 
SPEAKER3 1:43:25
and where you're standing up to the cliff 
SPEAKER2 1:43:32
precipice the top of this where to get onto that platform is a solid 12 15 feet high this one you're attacking is lower as it's holding on almost 
SPEAKER5 1:43:44
but end of your turn 
SPEAKER3 1:43:49
it says i will lead first 
SPEAKER2 1:43:53
and by 10 20 25 and 30 and here 
SPEAKER5 1:44:02
discard also 
SPEAKER1 1:44:07
and here 
SPEAKER5 1:44:07
single 
SPEAKER3 1:44:11
and 30 again there 
SPEAKER2 1:44:30
okay 
SPEAKER3 1:44:35
uh yeah okay cool this one is going to move five 10 10 feet this way get a better view this one is not starting making any give you this there's something other about it it's larger but it also seems older and less muscular limbs are longer and the claws that it ends in 
SPEAKER5 1:45:01
are shorter almost training 
SPEAKER3 1:45:07
yeah 
SPEAKER2 1:45:09
and the other one is a little bit more 
SPEAKER5 1:45:12
uh 
SPEAKER2 1:45:13
i'm gonna saunter my ass between these two dinguses block in the path uh let me see if i got enough room to get up there real quick uh start measuring yeah i should be able to get right up next door oh sorry i'm gonna squeeze by fours and i'm gonna go to the next one 
SPEAKER1 1:45:35
and i'm gonna go to the next one 
SPEAKER5 1:45:37
and personalized 
SPEAKER1 1:45:39
so i'm just going to take my fours and just 
SPEAKER2 1:45:43
make my way as i bump against every wall apparently to get there 
SPEAKER5 1:45:51
uh i don't see so i guess i'm just going to 
SPEAKER3 1:45:59
you know what you are hearing this the starling and now he's scratching something 
SPEAKER2 1:46:03
heavy scratch itself coming from ahead of him 
SPEAKER5 1:46:05
in the beginning 
SPEAKER2 1:46:05
can i hold an attack for anticipation of a fight? You can, it will take your action this round. I mean it's not like I can do anything else. 
SPEAKER3 1:46:17
So the way that holding an attack uses it burns your reaction and it basically lasts until your next turn. So if your next turn comes 
SPEAKER2 1:46:26
then you're not still holding an action, you take another action. Or continue holding an action. Then I'll just... 
SPEAKER1 1:46:34
I guess the only thing I can do is walk up here. So yeah, I'm just gonna wait. 
SPEAKER3 1:46:42
This guy is also going to move forward. 
SPEAKER2 1:46:48
Here. Forrest, you are up. 
SPEAKER4 1:46:52
Oh, I'm going to go... Can I... Can I squeeze past this guy if I ask again? 
SPEAKER3 1:47:07
Sure. 
SPEAKER4 1:47:08
Cool. Then I'm going to go 30 feet and I'm going to shoot this one in front of Ord. 
SPEAKER1 1:47:16
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:47:17
Let me figure out how to shoot that one. 
SPEAKER3 1:47:21
First, target them. 
SPEAKER1 1:47:23
Yeah, I don't know how to do that. 
SPEAKER3 1:47:25
So if you click on them, you should be able to right click. There's a target icon in the lower left hand corner. That should select who has the target. 
SPEAKER4 1:47:32
Cool. 
SPEAKER1 1:47:34
Uh, attack. 
SPEAKER4 1:47:37
Uh, and I'm going to add my 1v8. I got a 24, I think? 
SPEAKER3 1:47:54
I think? 
SPEAKER4 1:47:56
I don't know how this works. It says 24. I don't know why it's not sending it. 
SPEAKER5 1:48:04
I don't know. I rolled a... 
SPEAKER4 1:48:06
That's not telling me what I rolled. There should be a... 
SPEAKER2 1:48:09
So one should be for roll for the attack and the other one should be roll for damage. It won't post. Oh, it won't post until the time runs out. That's annoying. Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:48:16
I got a 24. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:17
Does that hit? 
SPEAKER2 1:48:18
24 does hit. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:19
Cool. 
SPEAKER4 1:48:19
Um, does Ord count as flanking? Ord would give you advantage, yes. No, for... 
SPEAKER5 1:48:26
Well, for advantage... 
SPEAKER3 1:48:27
I don't... Advantage was a little bit too high for me. 
SPEAKER4 1:48:30
But I would give you advantage. You can do it. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:32
I would give you advantage, yes. No. 
SPEAKER4 1:48:33
Well, advantage was for the attack. I meant for sneak attack. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:36
Ord would count as an enemy with threat, so yes. 
SPEAKER2 1:48:40
Excellent. So I get a 3d6. 
SPEAKER4 1:48:44
I've added to that one. 19 damage. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:51
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:53
All right. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:53
19 thunderous damage. I've sent an arc of a lightning bolt over Ord's head and into the back of his chest. It instantly looks... 
SPEAKER1 1:49:03
A little fucked up. 
SPEAKER5 1:49:04
Cool. 
SPEAKER1 1:49:08
That's my turn. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:09
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:49:11
All right. And if your turn... 
SPEAKER5 1:49:16
It is this guard's turn. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:19

SPEAKER2 1:52:50
Round two, Electric Boogaloo. 
SPEAKER1 1:52:53
She cannot affect me. Oh. It's almost like we had the same exact 
SPEAKER2 1:52:59
instance before. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:01
So, wait, wait. So, randomly clicking, if... Hypothetically, if the area that is selected right now is not part of the actual... Like, if it's off the cave, 
SPEAKER2 1:53:12
does it 
SPEAKER4 1:53:13
still have an effect? 
SPEAKER2 1:53:15
Only one way to find out what happens when you 
SPEAKER3 1:53:17
cast a spell that creates damage and seismic effects in another ground area. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:24
Are we gonna die? 
SPEAKER1 1:53:25
Oh, fuck me. God fucking damn it. Anyway, you cast a shatter. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:30
Um, I guess I did. Alright. 
SPEAKER1 1:53:37
Uh, it is a 
SPEAKER3 1:53:37
dexterity saving throw, correct? 
SPEAKER1 1:53:40
Uh, let me double check. Oh, a constitution saving throw. 
SPEAKER3 1:53:44
Wonderful. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:46
It's like 
SPEAKER5 1:53:47
physics and reactions and actions still exist in this world. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:51
I didn't think... 
SPEAKER1 1:53:53
for a second, okay, I was just being dumb. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:55
Or, if you wouldn't mind, 
SPEAKER3 1:53:57
a constitution saving throw, please. 
SPEAKER1 1:54:00
Constitution saving throw? Yep. You are cringe and... I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 1:54:07
You are in the radius, my man. I can't... 
SPEAKER1 1:54:10
I can't. You are a... You... are a goddamn hetero. I swear to God. Oh, if you cast this, you roll damage. 
SPEAKER5 1:54:20
Oh. Uh, uh... 
SPEAKER1 1:54:25
Don't I have... Wait... Oh, no, that's into the fuck. God damn it, Koi. Oh, sorry. 
SPEAKER3 1:54:34
Uh, 3d8? 
SPEAKER1 1:54:36
I had a fucking brain fart. 
SPEAKER2 1:54:38
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER4 1:54:40
It's gonna be like 40-something fucking damage. I can't see anything. Let me throw random magic 
SPEAKER3 1:54:44
where allies might be. 
SPEAKER2 1:54:46
The scholar be 
SPEAKER4 1:54:48
not scholaring right now. Guys, it's okay. We can cast magic down here. The ban is lifted. Let's just... Let's just go for it and see what we can hit. 
SPEAKER5 1:54:56
Let's just get a... 
SPEAKER1 1:54:58
chat for him. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:00
Alright. Or... 
SPEAKER3 1:55:03
I do not. 
SPEAKER1 1:55:04
If you wouldn't mind taking 16... 16 thunder damage. What type of damage is that? Thunder damage. I don't have... I can't have that. I apologize. 
SPEAKER4 1:55:16
If he's raging, he only takes half damage, right? 
SPEAKER3 1:55:18
Uh, only for certain types. 
SPEAKER1 1:55:20
It's only... It's only bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. 
SPEAKER5 1:55:24
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 1:55:26
I'm sorry. I... ... 
SPEAKER2 1:55:30
It's Hong Kong. 
SPEAKER1 1:55:32
Koi is bullying little people. 
SPEAKER3 1:55:34
You point into somewhere at the cave wall. You're thinking, there's probably an enemy. It's probably right where an enemy is. And you unleash the spell. Everyone else, a massive thunderous clash at like point blank range. It emanates and then resounds down the entire cave. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:54
This is one of those things where you can feel it in your 
SPEAKER3 1:55:56
lungs. And you can kind of feel a concussive force echoing down the walls themselves. Fits of rock and sand are probably going to pour down against this before eventually the cave stabilizes. I saw you had live 
SPEAKER1 1:56:08
video in like in the middle of the night, so 
SPEAKER3 1:56:12
you were like watching. It's Hong Kong. You're not sure who you hit, but you do hear notably the grunt 
SPEAKER2 1:56:18
of ore down the hallway. 
SPEAKER3 1:56:22
As well as the pained yelp of one of 
SPEAKER2 1:56:26
the creatures. 
SPEAKER1 1:56:30
You idiot, are you trying to kill us all? ... 
SPEAKER2 1:56:34
I saw Hong Kong 
SPEAKER3 1:56:36
was just gonna like 
SPEAKER1 1:56:38
cringe. 
SPEAKER3 1:56:40
Alright. Anything else in your turn? 
SPEAKER1 1:56:44
Umm... 
SPEAKER5 1:56:46
... 
SPEAKER3 1:56:48
Let me just look at one thing real fast. ... 
SPEAKER5 1:56:54
... 
SPEAKER2 1:56:56
... 
SPEAKER1 1:56:58
Ah, no. Nothing else right now. 
SPEAKER2 1:57:00
Okay. ... 
SPEAKER3 1:57:04
... ... 
SPEAKER5 1:57:08
... ... ... ... 
SPEAKER1 1:57:16
... 
SPEAKER3 1:57:18
... 
SPEAKER2 1:57:20
... 
SPEAKER1 1:57:22
... 
SPEAKER3 1:57:24
... ... ... 
SPEAKER1 1:57:30
... 
SPEAKER3 1:57:32
... ... ... ... ... ... ... It rises back up when it launches and snarls down. 
SPEAKER1 1:57:48
It wasn't breathing. It's snarling. Small, too wiggly. 
SPEAKER3 1:57:56
I have to ask, as it begins to make its back up, who's breathing? I had to pick it out with a fucking napkin. 
SPEAKER1 1:58:06
Come back. Huh? 
SPEAKER3 1:58:07
Come back. Is everyone okay, though? 
SPEAKER1 1:58:15
Wait, you're talking about me? Yeah, we can hear the... I assume that's you. It wasn't dead beforehand. 
SPEAKER5 1:58:23
It was dead... 
SPEAKER1 1:58:24
Okay, this might be a little bit better. 
SPEAKER2 1:58:27
What are they trying to kill? 
SPEAKER1 1:58:28
He's on the phone. I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 1:58:31
Okay, good to know. 
SPEAKER1 1:58:33
Anyway, moving on. Next up. 
SPEAKER3 1:58:36
I didn't pick it up. 
SPEAKER1 1:58:38
Big boy number two. 
SPEAKER3 1:58:40
Number two is going to come out this way. 
SPEAKER1 1:58:42
Hey, calm. Stop. 
SPEAKER3 1:58:45
And it's just kind of waiting for you. Dead. 
SPEAKER1 1:58:49
Before I got to it. 
SPEAKER2 1:58:53
Here. 
SPEAKER5 1:59:15
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:59:22
I dash. Okay. This guy, Mateus, who's been left at the back, is going to try and catch up. He's going to join you in this cavern. 
SPEAKER1 1:59:42
Dead. 
SPEAKER3 1:59:42
Or, you're up. 
SPEAKER5 1:59:45
You are on deck. 
SPEAKER3 1:59:48
In business, as they say. You're muted. 
SPEAKER2 1:59:56
Also. 
SPEAKER1 1:59:59
You know how long I've been waiting for this. Does a 15 hit? 
SPEAKER3 2:00:10
A 15 will hit. 
SPEAKER1 2:00:12
Oh, look. 
SPEAKER4 2:00:12
The demon's still there. 
SPEAKER1 2:00:13
Hee hee. Uh oh. Looks like I'm going to hit you with my silly 13 damage. Oh no. Oh no. 
SPEAKER3 2:00:23
This one now looks thoroughly fucked up. 
SPEAKER1 2:00:25
I won't. 
SPEAKER4 2:00:26
Does it look like it's about to die? Or has it still got a chunk left? 
SPEAKER1 2:00:31
It looks like another hit like that one. And it won't be. 
SPEAKER3 2:00:33
It won't be living. 
SPEAKER1 2:00:35
Okay. It's bloody. Well, fun fact. Ward has another hit like that. Oh, wow. 
SPEAKER3 2:00:41
You're going to hit it like that? 
SPEAKER1 2:00:44
I am, in fact, going to double hit it. You are going to hit it like that. For, uh, same amount of damage. Okay. Alright. 
SPEAKER3 2:01:00
You essentially leave it twice. And it is also dead. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:06
He's not out front, though. Axe to the neck. Axe to the jugular. He's dead. Alright. Alright. Now we're just going to... I'm just going to step back behind Fours a little bit. There you go. Well, hello. There's a couple more up ahead. If you want to fight. Come for a fight. What did I tell you? Alright. 
SPEAKER3 2:01:33
I'll be that. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:34
At the end of your turn, 
SPEAKER3 2:01:35
it becomes Anthem Koke. He's going to say, Well, excuse me. 
SPEAKER2 2:01:42
If two of you are fine, 
SPEAKER3 2:01:43
I could get him. 
SPEAKER4 2:01:45
I'm going to shove myself against the wall so I'm not at the front of the party. Because I am squishy. 
SPEAKER2 2:01:50
Sir, if you would mind. 
SPEAKER5 2:01:52
I'm on my seat. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:54
Yes, or it will also flatten against the wall. I'm on my seat. 
SPEAKER5 2:01:58
I'm on my seat. 
SPEAKER3 2:02:00
25, 30. He's going to go in. He's like, 
SPEAKER1 2:02:06
Here we go! 
SPEAKER3 2:02:08
And he's going to rush all the way in. And he's going to rush all the way in. 
SPEAKER5 2:02:12
Uh, I said that twice. I'm going to go in. I'm going to go in. I'm going to go in. 
SPEAKER3 2:02:21
Okay. And he gets to about where you were standing, but a bit farther in. 
SPEAKER2 2:02:27
And sees both of the, uh, 
SPEAKER3 2:02:29
he identifies, 
SPEAKER1 2:02:31
what he identifies as, 
SPEAKER2 2:02:32
quaggots. 
SPEAKER1 2:02:34
And he shoves back, 
SPEAKER5 2:02:35
There are quaggots down here! 
SPEAKER2 2:02:36
And then, 
SPEAKER1 2:02:38
What is he going to do next? 
SPEAKER3 2:02:39
You know what? 
SPEAKER5 2:02:40
I don't want him to play the step character. 
SPEAKER3 2:02:42
He's going to, 
SPEAKER5 2:02:44
What is he going to do? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, interesting. 
SPEAKER3 2:02:54
I forgot I gave him all the shit. Interesting. 
SPEAKER5 2:02:57
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:02:58
That's a lot. 
SPEAKER3 2:02:59
That's a lot. 
SPEAKER5 2:03:00
Alright. Alright. 
SPEAKER2 2:03:02
Jesus. 
SPEAKER5 2:03:03
Jesus. 
SPEAKER3 2:03:04
But none of it he can use right now. 
SPEAKER1 2:03:06
So he's going to, 
SPEAKER3 2:03:07
So he's going to, He's going to stay there, and he's going to hold his action, 
SPEAKER5 2:03:10
because soon, 
SPEAKER3 2:03:11
something comes within melee range, and he's going to attack him. 
SPEAKER2 2:03:13
And he's going to attack him.

SPEAKER1 2:07:11
Fuck that dude um I'm gonna use sacred flame on him. 
SPEAKER2 2:07:15
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:07:17
I'm gonna just I don't even know what sacred flame kind of looks like so I'm just gonna 
SPEAKER2 2:07:26
have to like just yeet what I assume is a fucking fireball that's like a snowball. 
SPEAKER3 2:07:31
It looks like whatever you'd like it to look like. 
SPEAKER1 2:07:35
Well for right now it's just a fucking pissball flame. It's ball of flame. All right. 
SPEAKER2 2:07:50
Okay I can't tell if that was damage roll but that makes no sense. 
SPEAKER1 2:07:57
It okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:07:58
Your what was your original roll to hit? 
SPEAKER2 2:08:01
It's got to do dexterity saving throw so. 
SPEAKER3 2:08:03
Dexterity saving throw? Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:05
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 2:08:08
I did not do a roll for hit so I guess I have to roll d20 yeah? 
SPEAKER3 2:08:13
Okay okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:08:16
Remind me how this works my guy. 
SPEAKER3 2:08:18
So sacred flame I'm reading through it as well. It is not a roll to hit it is a saving throw otherwise they take the damage. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:25
Okay well then there you go. 
SPEAKER3 2:08:27
They rolled a 13 on that certain throw. 
SPEAKER1 2:08:31
And it has to be my? 
SPEAKER3 2:08:32
It has to be your spell savings. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:35
My spell save DC is 14 so. 
SPEAKER5 2:08:37
And it failed. 
SPEAKER1 2:08:38
And it fails. Ah then I have rolled a 1d8 so you there 2d8 in this case so you take five. Um. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:47
Why is my HP low that's supposed to be filled. Oh excuse you put down the wrong character sheet when you put this in. 
SPEAKER1 2:08:58
Sorry. Um. 
SPEAKER2 2:09:08

SPEAKER3 2:12:54

SPEAKER5 2:13:12

SPEAKER3 2:13:36
all right it is also looking funny as you as you send out with the psychic energy towards this creature you see it's about to seize up and it grasps its head and there's a spur of blood 
SPEAKER2 2:13:53
elongated ears and bleed from the eye sockets 
SPEAKER3 2:13:59
nice anything else in your turn no okay first bracket's turn okay first bracket's turn no okay first bracket's turn no okay first bracket's turn here it is going to move up here and it is going to take two attacks one towards the first guard and one towards the end 
SPEAKER2 2:14:24
yep got a head 
SPEAKER5 2:14:31
the next one 14 is not going to get 
SPEAKER2 2:14:44
yep so he takes one claw attack swipes at the pike 
SPEAKER3 2:14:48
at the guy with the pike out knocks the pike out of his hand 
SPEAKER2 2:14:52
follows both of the armor on their either arms blood spurts out and gushes out from their front but they catch themselves before they fall the creature that tries to take 
SPEAKER3 2:15:02
another off-handed swipe first hand who then backs out of the way just barely 
SPEAKER2 2:15:08
avoiding the claws and gauntly and long and voting claws as they are here inches from his face ending that one's turn it's gonna be some other things turns 
SPEAKER5 2:15:26
let's see if it's five and two 
SPEAKER2 2:15:34
and 25. each you see 
SPEAKER3 2:15:39
it's like power scurries itself up and over and takes position behind the quad if he would initially uh begun to it's about begun to fight it is going to go ahead and also use its 
SPEAKER5 2:15:54
all day would it be in a disadvantage because it's over on the other side of the hill 
SPEAKER1 2:16:01
for its claws it cannot use that however it can't do that any more because it's not going to be able to do that on the other side of the hill it can't use it 
SPEAKER2 2:16:02
on the other side of the hill it can't use it on the other side of the остановing 
SPEAKER3 2:16:03
it can't use it on the other side of the hill it can't use it on the other side of the can use devouring intellect. As I can see you, and you are within ten feet, I'm going to go ahead 
SPEAKER2 2:16:12
and need you to make 
SPEAKER3 2:16:14
an intelligence save with that. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:16
I'm gonna go ahead and spit on you and say no. 
SPEAKER3 2:16:20
Wait, because you have the Ring of Mind Shield. 
SPEAKER5 2:16:22
I do. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:24
Then no. I'll spit at it. 
SPEAKER5 2:16:26
And be like, wha- whore. 
SPEAKER1 2:16:28
I believe 
SPEAKER3 2:16:30
if you have the Ring of Mind Shield, you are good to go. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:32
I do. And let me double check to make sure that I'm not fucking fooling myself. 
SPEAKER5 2:16:38
Uh... Creature's Reckon... Reaction... 
SPEAKER2 2:16:46
Prevents any telepathic connections. 
SPEAKER5 2:16:48
At least that's what I'm interpreting. 
SPEAKER1 2:16:50
I- I... 
SPEAKER5 2:16:52
I'm being correct. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:54
I think, but I don't think you are. I would preference... 
SPEAKER5 2:17:00
...Ring of Mind Shield. I monster him anyway. I monster him anyway. I monster him anyway. Recharge. Recharge. Recharge. Recharge. Recharge. Recharge. Recharge. Recharge. Recharge. Recharge. Oh, I also just super quick wanted to 
SPEAKER2 2:17:52
like, um, 
SPEAKER1 2:17:54
make sure it's still like, okay if I have to 
SPEAKER2 2:17:56
leave like kinda soon. 
SPEAKER3 2:17:58
Just wanna make sure we're doing okay. 
SPEAKER5 2:18:00
I mean, no, but okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:18:02
So... 
SPEAKER3 2:18:04
When you use your alignment or other creatures to make your thoughts 
SPEAKER4 2:18:06
come to your own line, 
SPEAKER3 2:18:08
know your alignment or know your creature type. It doesn't say it blocks devour intellect. 
SPEAKER2 2:18:16
But I will say 
SPEAKER3 2:18:18
it does, since that's kinda the entire point of those rings. 
SPEAKER2 2:18:20
I was gonna say, isn't that 
SPEAKER1 2:18:22
trying to telepathically connect 
SPEAKER2 2:18:24
the person to devour the intellect? 
SPEAKER3 2:18:26
Yes. So. So then? Then, it tries to use that, but it does not. You are unharmed. 
SPEAKER2 2:18:32
You are unharmed. My aforementioned spit at it. 
SPEAKER5 2:18:36
My aforementioned spit at it. Might be the sign. Might be the sign. Might be the sign. Might be the sign. 
SPEAKER3 2:18:46
Might be the sign. 
SPEAKER2 2:18:48
Roll 20 says, while wearing this ring you are immune to magic that allows it to control you. 
SPEAKER1 2:18:52
Yeah, okay. Nevermind. 
SPEAKER2 2:18:54
So, we already came to that assumption. 
SPEAKER3 2:19:00
Eastguard's gonna back up. Run up to the right of the right of your heart. 
SPEAKER5 2:19:04
Climb the tunnel. It's gonna look and say, 
SPEAKER3 2:19:06
Well, it looks like I ain't right getting to there. 
SPEAKER2 2:19:08
And it's gonna end their turn. Or, you are up. 
SPEAKER5 2:19:32
Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER3 2:19:34
Jake, you're muted. 
SPEAKER1 2:19:36
Jake, you're muted. 
SPEAKER5 2:19:38
Jake, you're muted. Oh, oh, oh. 
SPEAKER1 2:19:42
I be, I be doing silly things. I be, I be doing silly things. Okay, is this one up here? 
SPEAKER3 2:19:48
That one's still alive, yeah. Yep, still alive and it looks like there are now four of them. 
SPEAKER1 2:19:52
There are now what? 
SPEAKER3 2:19:54
One has split into four exact copies. Maybe every single one. 
SPEAKER5 2:19:58
Maybe every single one. Oh. Well, okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:20:04
Word doesn't like that very much. He's gonna go up here, at least. And that's five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty feet. Can I get up here? Can I get up here? 
SPEAKER3 2:20:14
Uh, with how much music do you have left? 
SPEAKER5 2:20:16
Uh, with how much music do you have left? 
SPEAKER2 2:20:18
Twenty feet. I'd say just barely, yes. I'd say just barely, yes. Alright. I didn't get up there. 
SPEAKER1 2:20:28
Oh, there's a thing back. Oh! Um, not a trick. 
SPEAKER2 2:20:34
Did I do it? 
SPEAKER1 2:20:36
Um, okay, well. For those of you with a ring of mind shielding, 
SPEAKER3 2:20:40
while I am blocking, or I'm allowing it to block things that try to reach out and influence your mind, 
SPEAKER2 2:20:46
it is not going to block all psychic damage. 
SPEAKER3 2:20:48
So I can still take damage from it. 
SPEAKER2 2:20:50
So I can still take damage from it. 
SPEAKER1 2:20:52
Yeah, right. 
SPEAKER2 2:20:54
I accept that. 
SPEAKER5 2:20:56
That makes sense. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:00
Well, for now, I'm gonna go back to the room. I'm gonna... Okay. I'm gonna start with this little guy. 
SPEAKER2 2:21:08
Uh, sorry, Drake moment. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:10
Uh, sorry, Drake moment. Hey, yo. 
SPEAKER5 2:21:14
And... 
SPEAKER2 2:21:16
And... 
SPEAKER1 2:21:18
Hoza! 
SPEAKER2 2:21:20
Doesn't 11 hit the little guy? 
SPEAKER1 2:21:22
Doesn't 11 hit the little guy? 
SPEAKER2 2:21:24
Nope. Oh, right. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:28
Well, I'm angy, so doesn't 8 hit the little guy? Well, I'm angy, so doesn't 8 hit the little guy? Also, no. Fuuuuuuck! Okay, well, Ord is, uh, 
SPEAKER2 2:21:38
a little panicked. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:40
Shakin' in his boots. Shakin' in his little gnomey boots. 
SPEAKER5 2:21:44
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:21:46
And out of movement. 
SPEAKER3 2:21:48
But anyway, if you end your turn, But anyway, if you end your turn, that'll bring us to Anthony's turn. He is going to go ahead, and he's going to use two steps forward this way, and step around this way to get the point, 
SPEAKER5 2:22:00
and three as advantage. 
SPEAKER3 2:22:02
Then, he's going to 
SPEAKER2 2:22:04
take two attacks 
SPEAKER3 2:22:06
against that 
SPEAKER2 2:22:08
quaggith with his sword. Woop! Actually, making an attack shakshank. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:22
Ha! Ha! Ha! 
SPEAKER3 2:22:24
Oh, I forgot how broken fighters can be. He's gonna make three attacks. 
SPEAKER5 2:22:28
Alright. Alright. 
SPEAKER2 2:22:48
Five seconds. One second. 
SPEAKER5 2:22:52
One second. Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:02
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:04
The first one is going to 
SPEAKER2 2:23:06
whiff complete as he 
SPEAKER3 2:23:08
sees his friend and tries to kind of like 
SPEAKER2 2:23:12
just in one hand take its head off, and it just 
SPEAKER3 2:23:16
barely lurches back. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:18
He says, ah, I see. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:20
And it's just going to dive in with two other successive attacks, trying to take 
SPEAKER2 2:23:24
the front two limbs off. The first attack is going to be a twenty-two. The first attack that hits is going to be a twenty-two. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:34
That will do. Let's see. 
SPEAKER5 2:23:36
Here. Bam! Do-do-do-do-do-do. It's nine points. 
SPEAKER3 2:24:00
Second one. 
SPEAKER2 2:24:02
And with a two-handed. 
SPEAKER5 2:24:06
Seven points. So, sixteen 
SPEAKER2 2:24:10
points of damage against this one. 
SPEAKER5 2:24:16
And then 
SPEAKER3 2:24:18
he's going to go ahead and 
SPEAKER2 2:24:20
action surge and do it again. Guys, you've got to . 
SPEAKER5 2:24:30
. . . . . . . 
SPEAKER2 2:24:44
Two more attacks land. 
SPEAKER5 2:24:46
. . 
SPEAKER2 2:24:50
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 2:24:52
Another eight. Ooh! . Jesus, fuck. . 
SPEAKER3 2:25:02
Yep. And with those two attacks, 
SPEAKER5 2:25:04
he just slogs away. . And it is dead. . 
SPEAKER2 2:25:12
. That will be the end of his turn. He just fucking ends the creature in front of him. . 
SPEAKER5 2:25:20
Bring us to . 
SPEAKER2 2:25:24
. 
SPEAKER3 2:25:26
. 
SPEAKER5 2:25:28
. 
SPEAKER2 2:25:30
. . 
SPEAKER3 2:25:34
. 
SPEAKER2 2:25:36
. . 
SPEAKER5 2:25:44
. 
SPEAKER2 2:25:46
. 
SPEAKER5 2:25:48
. . 
SPEAKER2 2:25:52
. . 
SPEAKER5 2:25:56
there is going to cast a heat metal on you. Your metal begins to glow. First, you feel it warm, 
SPEAKER2 2:26:03
and you're like, oh this is nice, this is nice. Before it begins to burn, searing into your skin, you feel it bubbling on you, and it glows a red hot. Let's see. So, as a heat metal, 
SPEAKER3 2:26:18
any physical contact with the object can exudate fire damage, one cast, and as a bonus action, each of its turns, it causes damage again. So, I'm going to take 2d8 fire damage. Go ahead and 
SPEAKER2 2:26:30
pull 2d8 up. That'll be 11 points of fire damage. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 2:26:52
Let's double check it. One moment. 
SPEAKER2 2:26:57
All right. 11 points. Okay. Done. 
SPEAKER4 2:27:08
And that will be its turn. 
SPEAKER3 2:27:12
Brings us to, Michi, your turn. Which bastard just cast that on me? This one right here. Oh yeah, and is that difficult train that traversed? It is not a difficult train since the ward is in the way, and since the guard has kind of blocked your other path off that slope. 
SPEAKER5 2:27:30
Hmm. Let's see how much distance I got now. 
SPEAKER3 2:27:38
Uh, can I move 10 feet? Yeah. So that, the square where the ward is occupying, will be 10 feet of your turn. 
SPEAKER2 2:27:48
So 10 for him, and then, so if I were to squeeze him to that corner right here? It would cost 20 feet of movement. 
SPEAKER3 2:27:52
Okay. So, I'm going to move 10 feet of movement. 
SPEAKER1 2:27:53
Okay. So, I'm going to move 10 feet of movement. 
SPEAKER5 2:27:54
So, I'm going to move 10 feet of movement. 
SPEAKER1 2:27:54
Okay. So, I'm going to move 10 feet of movement. 
SPEAKER2 2:27:54
Okay. So, I'm going to move 10 feet of movement. 
SPEAKER1 2:27:55
Can I swing over ward? 
SPEAKER3 2:27:58
How so? 
SPEAKER5 2:27:59
Uh, well, Michi can get big, so it wouldn't be a real hard problem to swing like that. 
SPEAKER3 2:28:06
It would still be difficult for him, unfortunately. 
SPEAKER5 2:28:09
Yeah. Um, okay. I guess, uh, I'm going to squeeze by ward and just be like, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me. I'm going to just move, shun by, 
SPEAKER2 2:28:19
just carefully making sure he doesn't get knocked over. 
SPEAKER5 2:28:23
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:28:24
Ah, so you're the bastard who decided to hit me. Fuck this. 
SPEAKER2 2:28:30
Uh, first attack, I'm going to go ahead and swipe at him with my greatsword. So, we're going to go ahead and do that. I forgot how to do basic attacks. 
SPEAKER5 2:28:41
Just give me one moment, please. 
SPEAKER2 2:28:44
Inventory and... VALIGENCE! With a great cleave, I'm just going to aim at what I think is the person. 
SPEAKER5 2:28:54
I'm going to go ahead and do a quick attack. I'm going to go ahead and do a quick attack. I'm going to go ahead and do a quick attack. 
SPEAKER2 2:28:58
Uh, shit. 
SPEAKER5 2:29:01
Yeah, should be fine. 
SPEAKER2 2:29:05
Does a 27 hit? 
SPEAKER3 2:29:08
A 27 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:17
You're going to take seven points. 
SPEAKER2 2:29:19
You swipe down, ready to deal damage. You hit, first you feel contact. 
SPEAKER5 2:29:23
I'm going to go ahead and do a quick attack. 
SPEAKER3 2:29:24
And then with the thing that you hit, shatters. 
SPEAKER5 2:29:26
Nothingness. 
SPEAKER2 2:29:28
You get one of two points. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:30
Bastard. Do I see this fucker behind me as well as I made my way? 
SPEAKER3 2:29:34
Uh, yes. Yes, you would. 
SPEAKER5 2:29:36
Mm. Mm. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:38
Okay. I see. 
SPEAKER2 2:29:40
This is going to be one of those instances. 
SPEAKER5 2:29:42
Um. 
SPEAKER2 2:29:44
We said bonus action, we can drink potions. 
SPEAKER5 2:29:46
Yep. Ah, fuck all that thing. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:52
I'm going to go ahead and burn this. 
SPEAKER2 2:29:54
Burn action surge. I am going to drink the bonus, uh, the potion has a bonus. And it's going to be fire breath. 
SPEAKER5 2:30:06
Okay. Uh. One second. 
SPEAKER2 2:30:12
So drinking it, that's the bonus action. God, my inventory's a mess. So I'm down to my, no more potions. 
SPEAKER5 2:30:20
On that, fire breath is active. 
SPEAKER2 2:30:22
Action surge is down. Zero. 
SPEAKER1 2:30:26
And I'm going to blow it at the fucker behind me. 
SPEAKER2 2:30:28
That's just like a, a blowing a kiss. Okay. You're going to have to do, let me double check on that bastard. Of course the description for the fire breath is wrong because I don't have the right character sheet. One second. 
SPEAKER5 2:30:38
I believe it's a dexterity saving throw. 
SPEAKER2 2:30:40
Okay. I'm going to go ahead and drink this. I'm going to drink this. 
SPEAKER5 2:30:46
I'm going to drink this. 
SPEAKER2 2:30:48
I'm going to drink this. 
SPEAKER5 2:30:50
I'm going to drink this. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:30:56
That'll be a 17. 
SPEAKER5 2:30:58
Uh, yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:00
It's a, a what? 
SPEAKER3 2:31:02
A 17. 
SPEAKER5 2:31:04
Okay, so I don't hit. Nope. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:08
Okay. I move on with my shit then. 
SPEAKER5 2:31:14
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:16
Alright. Anything else? 
SPEAKER5 2:31:18
Wait, your turn? 
SPEAKER2 2:31:20
No, I'm done with my turn. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:22
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 2:31:24
This card is going to go ahead and forward. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:26
5, 2, and 15. 
SPEAKER5 2:31:28
25. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:30
It's going to the other side. And then it's going to try to go around here as well. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:38
And then it's going to try to go around here as well. See what it can see. 
SPEAKER5 2:31:42
And there it's going to forward as you are up. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:44
And there it's going to forward as you are up. 
SPEAKER5 2:31:46
Um, Natalia had to leave. 
SPEAKER1 2:31:48
Um, Natalia had to leave. Uh, did you guys see the... Message? 
SPEAKER2 2:31:54
She put me in control for now. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:56
Since everyone is needing to leave, because I know Jaykos gets to leave, I'm probably going to hold it here at the top of the ground. 
SPEAKER5 2:32:02
I'm probably going to hold it here at the top of the ground. Okay. So. 
SPEAKER2 2:32:08
Good game, fellas. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:10
Good game, fellas. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:12
Sorry I didn't get all the way through combat. 
SPEAKER2 2:32:14
I will be eventually bringing back that one minute timer. I will be eventually bringing back that one minute timer. We may die to the next one. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:20
We may die tomorrow. But we live today. 
SPEAKER2 2:32:24
We live for ten more seconds. We live for ten more seconds. At least. At least. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:30
At least. 
SPEAKER2 2:32:32

Well, see you fellas next week. 
SPEAKER2 2:33:04
At the very least. 
SPEAKER1 2:33:06
I'll stick around online if y'all would like. 
SPEAKER2 2:33:08
I'm down for a few games. There will, for those of you still in chat, there will be some discussion of scheduling 
SPEAKER3 2:33:16
coming up. 
SPEAKER2 2:33:18
Because I know people's schedules are going to be changing. Some people are getting trapped, 
SPEAKER5 2:33:22
and other people are getting wrecked. 
SPEAKER1 2:33:24
Yeah, and I, with my job right now too, I don't know if I might eventually 
SPEAKER5 2:33:30
get scheduled for weekends. 
SPEAKER1 2:33:32
So I'll keep you updated 
SPEAKER5 2:33:34
on that as well. 
SPEAKER2 2:33:36
I am free most weeknights. My other D&D group is also talking about scheduling. So my schedule is a bit moody right now. But I will make either a doodle poll or some other poll and put it down. 
SPEAKER5 2:33:50
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:33:52
I will also be adding there is a prospective player 
SPEAKER3 2:33:56
