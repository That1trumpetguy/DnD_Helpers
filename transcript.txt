SPEAKER2 0:00:00
I'm gonna put a little hat. 
SPEAKER5 0:00:05
The party just decided to follow 
SPEAKER4 0:00:07
the rest of the floating parkings who initially 
SPEAKER1 0:00:14
while a bit 
SPEAKER4 0:00:16
skeptic 
SPEAKER1 0:00:17
led you along an alternate 
SPEAKER4 0:00:21
path, a means of escaping 
SPEAKER1 0:00:22
deeper and darker threats that existed 
SPEAKER4 0:00:25
in larger areas of this area 
SPEAKER1 0:00:26
along the main path. 
SPEAKER5 0:00:29
During that time 
SPEAKER4 0:00:30
Jizzer and Orr decided to teach a little bit of altruistic, although ill-advised 
SPEAKER1 0:00:37
help to the voice that made out the developments. 
SPEAKER4 0:00:43
Stumbling again into combat and getting hit harder they then decided to follow the parts as well. They were led down various narrow caverns around the bend and fronted into a large drop 
SPEAKER1 0:00:56
on the next level, whatever 
SPEAKER4 0:00:58
is structured. Orr and Jizzer and Elvin were not so stealthy as they were led 
SPEAKER1 0:01:05
and ended up being 
SPEAKER4 0:01:07
wrapped up in a bit of combat 
SPEAKER1 0:01:09
in which Orr fell. Jizzer was brought to the brink 
SPEAKER4 0:01:13
and our bird friend that's on the phone got traumatized again. 
SPEAKER1 0:01:17
In the meantime 
SPEAKER4 0:01:19
Junoon decided to press forward descending deeper into the caverns and further into the threats that lie there. Getting into a bit of combat made more incestive and eventually falling to a rope that was not going to be used. 
SPEAKER3 0:01:35
Because that moment 
SPEAKER4 0:01:37
with Junoon on the ground 
SPEAKER1 0:01:39
barely holding on 
SPEAKER4 0:01:41
to a small font of life while in the clutches of this rope that we will resume. As such 
SPEAKER3 0:01:49
we're going to begin that round 
SPEAKER4 0:01:51
capture. The initiative started rolling. The ground was still very low. The ground was still very low. The initiative started rolling. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:00
Junoon, at the end of your last turn 
SPEAKER4 0:02:02
you came up at one hit point. You are unconscious, correct? 
SPEAKER3 0:02:06
Yes. Cool. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:16
It is the Roper's turn. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:18
Mmmmm. 
SPEAKER6 0:02:20
Yummy. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:22
Junoon. Doggo snack. Pick a limb. Mmm. Pinky toe. 
SPEAKER1 0:02:30
Pinky toe. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:32
Pinky toe. Left or right? 
SPEAKER4 0:02:36
Mmmmm. 
SPEAKER6 0:02:38
Right. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:40
With a sickening punch 
SPEAKER4 0:02:42
with a sickening punch your right leg is bit off 
SPEAKER3 0:02:46
at the hand. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:48
You are now taking two failed death saving throws as part of the melee attack and will be making more death saving throws on the next turn. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:58
Now, 
SPEAKER4 0:03:04
top of the turn, everyone else, 
SPEAKER5 0:03:08
comment has ended. You remember you are currently now coalescing 
SPEAKER3 0:03:12
and talking. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:14
Um, Org has just been revived. I will also need to know who is going to be playing 
SPEAKER1 0:03:20
or voicing for Org this time. 
SPEAKER3 0:03:26
Anybody? 
SPEAKER2 0:03:28
He didn't discuss it with anyone. 
SPEAKER5 0:03:30
Cool. Or it is mine. 
SPEAKER6 0:03:33
Oh lord. Here we go again. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:37
So. 
SPEAKER5 0:03:39
I'm going to start a timer for one minute. You have one minute, 
SPEAKER4 0:03:42
everyone else, to discuss what you're doing. 
SPEAKER5 0:03:44
At which point, round eight will begin in June. 
SPEAKER6 0:03:52
I'm going to go ahead and start looking through my inventory, and I'm going to chug a vial of vitality that I had stolen away, and the big-ass chugging vial that Forrest had. What's McCall it gave to me? Cool. 
SPEAKER4 0:04:09
I was doing what? 
SPEAKER2 0:04:13
I'm going to chill with Michi and make sure that I'm not about to die of all the wounds from everything, and then see what the plan is. 
SPEAKER6 0:04:25
Anybody know what the fuck's going on here? 
SPEAKER2 0:04:27
We are missing Trinun and the bird. They're still outside, I think. Does anyone have any idea where they went? 
SPEAKER5 0:04:43
No idea. 
SPEAKER6 0:04:46
Okay. That's great. Well, I don't want 
SPEAKER5 0:04:49
to stand around here. I'm already fucking 
SPEAKER6 0:04:51
hurting, so let me give me a second and we can proceed back. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:55
Okay. Oh, sorry. 
SPEAKER5 0:04:57
It is now Trinun. Please make it that same 
SPEAKER1 0:04:59
as that. 
SPEAKER2 0:05:03
Yippee! Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. 
SPEAKER6 0:05:08
Uh, I need to take that item from your inventory, if you don't mind. 
SPEAKER2 0:05:12
You do not need to roll because you positive number of hit points. Uh, I'm 
SPEAKER6 0:05:17
it, it, it, it, 
SPEAKER3 0:05:19
okay. It won't let me, 
SPEAKER2 0:05:21
so I'm just going to go back to zero hit points. So it lets me do it. That's saving you. 
SPEAKER3 0:05:25
Roll. Yippee. 
SPEAKER4 0:05:30
One success and two failures. 
SPEAKER5 0:05:34
Okay, can I ask a question? 
SPEAKER3 0:05:36
Oh, there we go. 
SPEAKER4 0:05:39
Ask your question. 
SPEAKER2 0:05:40
Okay, um, so 
SPEAKER5 0:05:41
on my sheet last session, I casted, like, the tiny hut, 
SPEAKER3 0:05:46
and I'm 
SPEAKER5 0:05:48
not seeing it on my sheet now. I was gonna see if I could try, I don't think I have the spell slot anyways, but in that minute, I was just trying to see if I could even cast it. around where Janoon is, but I'm not seeing it on my sheet at all now, so. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:01
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 0:06:02
You also have no idea where Janoon is. 
SPEAKER2 0:06:04
Okay, wait, I thought I would, I thought I had looked 
SPEAKER5 0:06:06
down and seen, oh no, I hadn't seen Janoon down there, only the dog, I think? 
SPEAKER4 0:06:12
You, you had at about three or four turns ago. Now, if you look down, you see nothing. 
SPEAKER6 0:06:19
Any huts added to your list? 
SPEAKER5 0:06:21
Okay, okay, thank you. 
SPEAKER6 0:06:23
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:06:25
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:27
I guess... You had a minute. 
SPEAKER5 0:06:32
Next up was the roper. Janoon, pick a different 
SPEAKER4 0:06:34
level. 
SPEAKER5 0:06:37
Wait, that whole action 
SPEAKER6 0:06:39
of Koi asking a question counted as the minute? 
SPEAKER5 0:06:41
No, I said you guys had a minute on the top of the turn to discuss 
SPEAKER4 0:06:45
what all of you were doing. 
SPEAKER6 0:06:47
On the previous one, and you did twice, so I was curious. 
SPEAKER5 0:06:50
That was the top of the turn, but it was Janoon making 
SPEAKER4 0:06:52
Deathsaber throw, now it's the roper's turn, and it'll be the top of the combat round to get. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:57
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:06:58
I'm gonna pick. Can't I just roll? 
SPEAKER5 0:07:01
You did roll your Deathsaber, but you just did. 
SPEAKER2 0:07:04
No. Can't I pick a... Can't I roll for a limb? 
SPEAKER5 0:07:07
Oh, you could roll for a limb. 
SPEAKER2 0:07:10
Yeah, I wanna do that. I don't like picking. 
SPEAKER6 0:07:16
What do you... 
SPEAKER2 0:07:16
How many sides of die am I rolling? 
SPEAKER5 0:07:19
Oh, there's no three-sided die anymore. 
SPEAKER4 0:07:23
So, roll a d4, and on a one, roll again. 
SPEAKER3 0:07:27
Hmm. 
SPEAKER6 0:07:41
Also, you're gonna have to give me a minute, because I'm still working on some items here. Give me a little bit more grace on that. 
SPEAKER3 0:07:48
Two. 
SPEAKER6 0:07:50
Two? 
SPEAKER5 0:07:51
Okay, what limb goes with two? 
SPEAKER4 0:07:53
I'm assuming one of your arms? 
SPEAKER2 0:07:56
Umm. 
SPEAKER5 0:07:57
Once with right leg, let's take the left arm. 
SPEAKER4 0:08:00
Another sickening crunch as at kind of the upper part of your forearm. Another bite of your limb comes away. That is another two-fail death save, because your character is now dead. No need to make any more death saves. But what that does start is essentially ten rounds, or Revivify can't bring your character back any either. Top of the round, the party has another minute. You're deciding what to do. Time to start it now. 
SPEAKER3 0:08:37
I say he's sometimes trying to wave towards the others, and kind of making bird noises, like trying to grab their attention. As he's looking over. 
SPEAKER5 0:08:51
I see the sledge. 
SPEAKER3 0:08:52
Hmm? What's that bird? 
SPEAKER2 0:08:54
Can we hear what he's talking about? 
SPEAKER6 0:08:57
I can see it. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:01
Ah, okay. 
SPEAKER6 0:09:02
What? What is going on, bird? 
SPEAKER5 0:09:05
He's gonna point down... He's gonna mimic kind of the sound of, like, one of the dogs barking, and point down the hole. 
SPEAKER6 0:09:13
Yeah. Alright. Let's go, goes. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:15
Are we gonna go get this shit, or what? 
SPEAKER6 0:09:17
I have a feeling we're missing another person here. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:21
Of you. 
SPEAKER6 0:09:22
I'm gonna start making my way there. With haste. I will follow after. 
SPEAKER4 0:09:26
Okay, good. 
SPEAKER3 0:09:27
Sure. 
SPEAKER5 0:09:28
He somehow will go behind everyone, like kind of last to crawl down as they come down. 
SPEAKER6 0:09:34
I'm updating my points because I used my potion. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:36
Um, I'm... Can I hold an action to... If I, um, if I see anything sketchy looking, um, that I shoot an arrow at it? 
SPEAKER1 0:09:49
Um... 
SPEAKER4 0:09:50
Um, sure. But first, let's have everyone roll initiative. Three of you have been added. Jesus, are you going down as well? 
SPEAKER3 0:09:56
Uh, sure. You must. 
SPEAKER1 0:09:59
Oh, hold on. I gotta target my token. 
SPEAKER2 0:10:02
Um... 
SPEAKER3 0:10:03
I don't know where we are. 
SPEAKER4 0:10:06
Okay. So, are you in the, uh... Are you in Foundry? 
SPEAKER3 0:10:12
Yeah. But I don't know what this, like, setting is. 
SPEAKER5 0:10:17
So, you are in the cave. 
SPEAKER1 0:10:19
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 0:10:20
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:10:21
Hmm? 
SPEAKER2 0:10:22
There. 
SPEAKER3 0:10:23
But, like, what happened to the ropers? 
SPEAKER2 0:10:25
We killed them last round. 
SPEAKER3 0:10:27
You killed them? Yeah, we killed them, but, like, last I remember, I was, like, in that room with them still. 
SPEAKER5 0:10:33
Yeah, we started going back. 
SPEAKER6 0:10:35
Yes, you were not paying attention. What happened to me? Where are you? 
SPEAKER3 0:10:39
I don't remember. 
SPEAKER5 0:10:42
Exactly. So, Jizzit will figure it out as we go. But anyway, if you're following the party, you descend. 
SPEAKER3 0:10:46
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:10:47
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 0:10:48
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 0:10:49
You either pay attention or you die. That's how I'm going with things right now. 
SPEAKER3 0:10:52
I mean, I was. 
SPEAKER5 0:10:54
Clearly you were. 
SPEAKER1 0:10:55
Anyway... 
SPEAKER5 0:10:57
So... 
SPEAKER3 0:10:58
Mechie's rolled for initiative. 17. Cool. 
SPEAKER5 0:11:02
Soundcard got a five. 
SPEAKER3 0:11:07
Fucking trapped in the office. 
SPEAKER4 0:11:09
Yeah. Jizzit, if you would roll initiative. 
SPEAKER3 0:11:16
Uh... shit, where's the button? There it is. 18. 
SPEAKER4 0:11:24
Cool. Top of this turn. Forrest, you are up. Yeah, actually. Yep. The first thing you see as you come down and round the corner, this is a 20, 30-foot descent. This one actually does have these rough camels that are carved into the side of the cave wall, essentially. So this one is much easier to cut down. This is a much wider expanse. As you reach the end, sort of advanced walk on the corner, the immediate thing that hits you and your perception is the smell of blood. Lots of it. Everywhere. And you hear off to your right the sickening crunch of something stone grinding on the floor. 
SPEAKER2 0:12:06
Cool. Um, I'm gonna move towards it. I'm still in stealth. And... 
SPEAKER3 0:12:15
See what it is and ready my bow. 
SPEAKER2 0:12:16
Okay. And ready my bow to shoot. What is it? 
SPEAKER4 0:12:21
What you see as you round this corner is yet another Roper. This time, dining on the lifeless and limp corpse of Jun. 
SPEAKER2 0:12:31
Alright, as soon as I see it's a Roper, I'm gonna just shoot it. Um, is... it's in our turn order, correct? 
SPEAKER5 0:12:39
Yep. 
SPEAKER2 0:12:40
Okay. Um, in that case, so I'm gonna shoot it. I'm gonna roll with advantage because of my rogue thing that I just realized I had. Yep. That I just realized I had when we were going through. Um... How do I figure out how to target it? Which... where is the token? 
SPEAKER4 0:12:55
For what? 
SPEAKER5 0:12:57
To target the Roper, to shoot it. 
SPEAKER4 0:12:59
You have to move into it last time for it. 
SPEAKER2 0:13:02
I can... ah, okay. I'm gonna target that. I'm gonna shoot that with that. 
SPEAKER3 0:13:09
Did that work? Did that do? Attack with advantage. 
SPEAKER1 0:13:14
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:13:17
Uh, I think it's the 17. 
SPEAKER5 0:13:20
It's not hit. 
SPEAKER2 0:13:21
Darn it. Okay. Womp womp. Um, I'm gonna move... not gonna move. I'm gonna stay in and ready to shoot again. 
SPEAKER5 0:13:31
Cool. What do you remind me what your stealth check was last time? 
SPEAKER2 0:13:36
Um... I don't remember. 
SPEAKER3 0:13:39
Okay. Would you remind me to re-roll it? 
SPEAKER5 0:13:41
Um, nope. Um... I get advantage because of my hood, so it'll be a 16. 
SPEAKER1 0:13:48
Cool. 
SPEAKER4 0:13:52
A 16? Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER5 0:13:59
That's so low. I'm screwed. I thought you had higher than that on your last roll. 
SPEAKER2 0:14:09
I did, but I don't remember... probably, but I don't remember what I got. 
SPEAKER5 0:14:13
End of your turn. Chaser, you are up. 
SPEAKER1 0:14:15
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:17
I'm gonna... I guess just round this corner and see what's going on. 
SPEAKER4 0:14:23
What you see before you is a very familiar sight. You see it countless times now. But instead of just a friend in the grasp of Brober, it is you. A half-limbless corpse, bloodied and beaten up genuineness. With a head lifeless and bloodied. 
SPEAKER1 0:14:41
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:42
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:14:43
Uh... I mean, that's not good. 
SPEAKER5 0:14:52
I guess I'll just... continue being in Roper killing mode. 
SPEAKER1 0:15:00
And do the chill touch that bee. 
SPEAKER5 0:15:04
Alright, do it. 
SPEAKER3 0:15:06
Oh shit, okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:15:10
Um... I guess there's like these new things now? Do I just... 
SPEAKER3 0:15:20
Oh fuck, how do I do this? 
SPEAKER6 0:15:22
What are you trying to do? 
SPEAKER1 0:15:24
There's like all these spell buttons, and I don't know how to use them. 
SPEAKER6 0:15:28
So, target the thing with the little, uh... Right left side of your screen, there's a little thing that says target. 
SPEAKER1 0:15:34
Select the mob, and then click the ability. I'm trying. Uh... But essentially the same way as before. Oh, there it is. 
SPEAKER2 0:15:47
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:15:48
Okay, I'm getting it. Hold on. 
SPEAKER1 0:15:50
But bam. Did that work? 
SPEAKER5 0:15:52
Look in chat, roll fruit damage. 
SPEAKER1 0:15:53
Oh. Uh... I have to roll attack and then damage, right? That's correct. 
SPEAKER5 0:15:57
Okay. Ah! 
SPEAKER3 0:15:59
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:00
I don't think an 11 hits, does it? 
SPEAKER5 0:16:01
It will not. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:02
It will not. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:03
It will not. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:04
It will not. It will not. It will not. 
SPEAKER3 0:16:07
It will not. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:08
It will not. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:09
It will not. It will not. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:11
It will not. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:12
Shit. That's me. I like this music. It really... I said I like this music. 
SPEAKER2 0:16:17
It really puts it in like a really scary, eerie, sad mood. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:26
I also really like this soundtrack actually. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:29
Good! 
SPEAKER2 0:16:30
It does go with the mood really well. 
SPEAKER6 0:16:33
Thank you. 
SPEAKER4 0:16:34
Choozer, you reach out, ready to kill yet another roper that is now eating your friend. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:37
You hit it with your chill touch, and it bounces. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:38
You hit it with your chill touch, and it bounces. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:39
You hit it with your chill touch, and it bounces. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:40
You hit it with your chill touch, and it bounces. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:41
Hardlessly off the stone, it happens. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:42
You hit it with your chill touch, and it bounces. Hardlessly off the stone, it happens. You hit it with your chill touch, and it bounces. Hardlessly off the stone, it happens. Michi, you're up. Alright, Michi's gonna go on through, everybody. Let me see how much movement speed I got here. So we're apparently here. Do do do do do do do. Thirty. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:52
I'm moving in. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:53
Fuck that shit. Oh, crap, I can't see anything. Is that thirty for me? Twenty. That's twenty-five. Fine, fuck it. Uh, Jinu's not right there, right? No. Cool. I'm not even sure what I'm doing. I'm just trying to make it look weird. Sure, I was gonna go ahead and I'm going to use Fury the Small. Should hit from this distance? Yes. Should? Yeah. Yep, we're gonna go ahead and smack this motherfucker with a goddamn sword. And I'm gonna apply Fury the Small. 
SPEAKER2 0:17:19
Uh, extra damage equals two to your level, so it'll be a six. 
SPEAKER5 0:17:20
Target. 
SPEAKER1 0:17:21
Go on inventory. Our target's pretty good, so I'll use the sword. I'm gonna go ahead and attack. I'm gonna attack. I'm gonna attack. I'm gonna attack. 
SPEAKER5 0:17:29
I'm gonna attack. 
SPEAKER1 0:17:30
I'm gonna attack. I'm gonna attack. I'm gonna attack. 
SPEAKER5 0:17:33
I'm gonna attack. 
SPEAKER1 0:17:34
I'm gonna attack. I'm gonna attack. Attack with the Great of Vengeance. That was within range. I love that. Does that hit? Another attack. The third team tries to sever the tendril that is holding Genune firm to the maw of this beast. 
SPEAKER5 0:18:00
And you swing to him and whips around, ripping the rest of the flesh 
SPEAKER1 0:18:04
of the arm that was connected as it was grinding and chewing away at you out of its socket. The entire right side of their torso gets the flesh ripped off of the face as it yanks Genune out and maintains a grasp on him. This is bullshit. Yes I am. I'm gonna go ahead and drink one more fucking fire breath potion. Okay. And that ends my bonus action. Uh, so hold on. Yeah, cause that was a bonus action for drinking, correct? Yep. Alright, then I hold. Cool. Next up is Horde. Horde is going to lose 5, 10, 15, 16, no, 30. And is fucked up enough to be cautious. They're not going to do anything, they're going to hold their action. 
SPEAKER5 0:19:06
It is now the Roper's turn. Wait, Horde can also throw axes. Please don't forget. You know, actually, yeah, let's do that. 
SPEAKER1 0:19:14
Uh, he is going to go ahead and rage. And then throw an axe. Did I just get kicked? I held on. Oh. Who left? 
SPEAKER4 0:19:38
Uh, no one. No one left. Is Discord being stupid? Yeah, not sure. But, Horde goes, he throws his axe, 
SPEAKER5 0:19:50
he is battered and bloodied and bruised, and just not happy. 
SPEAKER4 0:19:54
This axe hits the creature, but once again, Galax is off the stone that makes up its construction. 
SPEAKER3 0:20:00
Then Galax's turn. It is now the Roper's turn. 
SPEAKER5 0:20:12
It's, can't play with all the tracks, but that's okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:16
Um, it has one Pendle on Janude, one Pendle on one of the dogs. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:20
It is going to go after... 
SPEAKER4 0:20:24
It's going to go after Michi, and it's going to go after... 
SPEAKER1 0:20:28
Horde, and it's going to go after the boys. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:32
Horde, and it's going to go after the boys. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:36
Alright. 
SPEAKER5 0:20:40
Who's, um, a reaction? 
SPEAKER4 0:20:44
Yep. Can I use a reaction? Michi does a 25 hit. Yes, you can. 
SPEAKER5 0:20:56
It does. Can I use... 
SPEAKER3 0:20:58
Unsettling Visage? 
SPEAKER1 0:21:00
Sure, what does it do? 
SPEAKER2 0:21:02
To give it disadvantage on the... 
SPEAKER3 0:21:04
It gives it disadvantage. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:06
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:21:08
Okay, so Michi, 25 
SPEAKER4 0:21:12
a hit, so you are... Wait. 
SPEAKER5 0:21:14
So, is she using that for me, or is she using it for... It only works for her character. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:18
Then I'm fucking using Lucky. Reroll that shit. This is... 
SPEAKER5 0:21:22
Sorry, I'm trying to... The internet's being bad. 
SPEAKER4 0:21:28
That's okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:21:30
I'm rerolling? Yeah. I'm using Lucky Point. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:34
No. 10 does not hit Horde. 
SPEAKER5 0:21:40
Jizu does a 16 hit 
SPEAKER4 0:21:42
for you. Nope. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:48
And a 10 does not hit Florence. 
SPEAKER3 0:21:52
It does not. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:54
And that is... all you can do at the moment. Songkwan, you're up. 
SPEAKER5 0:22:04
Songkwan's going to... Get him off, bud. Quickly scurry all the way down to about here and kind of make a sliding like land as he tries to grab one of 
SPEAKER1 0:22:20
Janoon's arms 
SPEAKER5 0:22:22
and pull it away from the rope. 
SPEAKER1 0:22:26
And then he's going to get hit by a hooker. 
SPEAKER4 0:22:32
Red? 
SPEAKER1 0:22:34
Red? It's not... No, make a fake check. That's what you're doing. 
SPEAKER5 0:22:40
How's the role playing just watching this? 
SPEAKER4 0:22:44
Wait, sorry, what's I get? No, this bird is going to be 
SPEAKER1 0:22:48
so fucking traumatized. This bird is going to need so much therapy. 
SPEAKER5 0:22:52
Red, spells, not hands. I'm going to go to the office because this is a... 
SPEAKER4 0:22:56
it is usually a contested strength check against whoever is grappling. 
SPEAKER5 0:22:58
However, you are trying to 
SPEAKER1 0:23:00
pull a corpse from the tangle and you need to see. You've stretched 
SPEAKER4 0:23:04
what is left of Janoon's corpse 
SPEAKER1 0:23:06
out of the one tangle that wraps 
SPEAKER4 0:23:08
around their waist. You now have a bloody half-corpse of your previous strength. 
SPEAKER5 0:23:14
Can I use a bonus action to shove Janoon's corpse in my bag 
SPEAKER1 0:23:18
of holding? Sure, let's do it. 
SPEAKER4 0:23:26
Sure, let's do it. 
SPEAKER2 0:23:28
Can I ask a question? Can I ask a question? Uh-huh. What is left of Janoon? 
SPEAKER5 0:23:36
What, like, 
SPEAKER2 0:23:38
was the bag of holding 
SPEAKER5 0:23:40
eaten? What is ravaged 
SPEAKER1 0:23:42
left? 
SPEAKER5 0:23:44
So you chose your right leg 
SPEAKER1 0:23:46
and your left arm. Both of them are gone. 
SPEAKER5 0:23:50
Your right leg is not even 
SPEAKER1 0:23:52
a stump. Up to your waist, it is gone. Up to your waist, it is gone. Of your 
SPEAKER5 0:23:58
left arm, not only is 
SPEAKER1 0:24:00
the arm completely gone, but because it was ripped out of its mouth prematurely, it 
SPEAKER5 0:24:06
tore the flesh from your left shoulder 
SPEAKER1 0:24:08
off, and all of 
SPEAKER5 0:24:10
the skin and flesh that comes down 
SPEAKER1 0:24:12
that side of the torso where the ribs normally protect 
SPEAKER5 0:24:14
has been ripped away. 
SPEAKER1 0:24:16
Your ribs are exposed, and the 
SPEAKER4 0:24:18
lungs and organ and viscera that are in are just hanging free. 
SPEAKER2 0:24:22
Jesus fucking Christ. 
SPEAKER1 0:24:24
Hold on, I gotta do a gif for this. 
SPEAKER2 0:24:30
I'm just thinking of, like, fucking shit from Corpse Party. Anyways. That's not my question. My question was, what is saved? Is my bag of holding saved, essentially? Or did it 
SPEAKER1 0:24:42
get eaten? I would say most of your items that were just hanging on you are now on the frame. Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:24:52
Janoon's looking like one of those dogs when a dog, like, kinda de-stuffs it. You are horrible. You are horrible. 
SPEAKER1 0:25:04
Oh! Oh. 
SPEAKER2 0:25:12
All of you, 30 years dungeon. 
SPEAKER5 0:25:14
Now. Apologies, Gears. Apology video now with Gears. 
SPEAKER1 0:25:20
Edward Ulrich asks. 
SPEAKER5 0:25:22
I also wanna... Oh yeah, sorry. I also wanna add, like, when Isanhan did, like, a sliding land like, to grab Janoon, he kinda stayed low to the 
SPEAKER1 0:25:30
ground, so he's, like, prone still. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:25:34
You are prone on the ground, shoving half a corpse 
SPEAKER1 0:25:36
into a bag. 
SPEAKER5 0:25:38
Ah, very well. You did good. Alright. That's the end of your turn. Up next, Forrest, you got the top of the round. 
SPEAKER2 0:25:48
Cool. I'm going to move, um, 
SPEAKER1 0:25:52
over 
SPEAKER2 0:25:54
Nope, that's not letting me. I'm gonna move a little bit once it lets me. And then I'm gonna shoot it again. Uh, I'm, I'm s- from stealth. If it'll, it'll move, like, to the side so I can get a better angle. Um, bonus 
SPEAKER5 0:26:08
action to hide and then shoot it. Okay, so 
SPEAKER1 0:26:10
you're coming out of stealth, moving, and then trying to stealth again? 
SPEAKER2 0:26:14
Well, I'm, I'm attempting to, I'm staying in stealth, I suppose, to move. I'm just attempting to hide better. 
SPEAKER5 0:26:20
Okay, re-roll stealth. Clearly it 
SPEAKER1 0:26:22
saw me. Re-roll stealth, and then I'm gonna take your... 
SPEAKER5 0:26:26
Yeah. 23! Normally 
SPEAKER1 0:26:28
to, to hide is an action. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:30
I'm a rogue. I can do it as bonus 
SPEAKER1 0:26:32
action. So 23? Yeah. Cool. Yep. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:36
And then I'm gonna shoot it, which means that I have to figure out how the targeting works again. Which means I do that, and then that, and then 
SPEAKER3 0:26:44
that. 
SPEAKER1 0:26:46
Nope. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:48
Okay. Nevermind. 
SPEAKER5 0:26:50
You feel very good. That's my turn. However, 
SPEAKER4 0:26:52
your arrows are just being 
SPEAKER1 0:26:54
searched, and you're not sure. 
SPEAKER5 0:26:56
It now has a free mouth, essentially, at which it opens, and a screech emerges as the remaining 
SPEAKER1 0:27:04
tentacles flail into space. Hmm. 
SPEAKER5 0:27:08
That is your turn. Yep. And Jizu, you're up 
SPEAKER1 0:27:10
next. I, uh, she'll touch again. Okay. Ba-oh. Bam. Fuck. 
SPEAKER5 0:27:24
It's on that one. Okay. That's straight up unfortunate. 
SPEAKER1 0:27:28
You're confused. You're dazed. You're being a shit. 
SPEAKER5 0:27:34
Describe how this natural one fails for you. 
SPEAKER1 0:27:36
Um. 
SPEAKER5 0:27:40
Jizu goes 
SPEAKER3 0:27:42
to take, like, a power stance to cast a chill touch. 
SPEAKER5 0:27:46
But kinda like, halfway through casting, 
SPEAKER3 0:27:48
halfway through stancing, I guess there was, like, a loose rock by his foot. And he just flops over. You know. Trips over the rock. Not very good balance. And, uh, face plants into the earth, trying to 
SPEAKER1 0:28:06
cast chill touch. 
SPEAKER3 0:28:10
Okay. Alright. He's very 
SPEAKER5 0:28:14
tired. You're very tired, and you 
SPEAKER3 0:28:16
are dying. 
SPEAKER4 0:28:18
You're, you're essentially, you're not 
SPEAKER3 0:28:20
having a great time. Yeah. Jizu needs a nap. Jizu just needs a nap. So. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:28:30
What is going on? 
SPEAKER3 0:28:32
What is going on? What is going on? 
SPEAKER1 0:28:36
What is going on? What is going on? 
SPEAKER3 0:28:40
What is going on? 
SPEAKER4 0:28:42
What is going on? So. That is the end of your turn. Michi, you are up. 
SPEAKER6 0:28:48
Music will come back in a second. Oh. Okay. Fix that. 
SPEAKER3 0:28:52
Ah, shit. Uh. Shit. I'm gonna go ahead and 
SPEAKER6 0:28:58
swipe at this motherfucker again. 
SPEAKER3 0:29:00
But I'm also 
SPEAKER6 0:29:02
going to put up my Twilight Sanctuary. 
SPEAKER3 0:29:06
Because fuck this piece of shit. 
SPEAKER5 0:29:08
So Michi's going to 
SPEAKER3 0:29:10
hole. Oh well. Ow. English, please. 
SPEAKER6 0:29:16
You're gonna hear a chime. As the light dims again. 
SPEAKER3 0:29:20
Oh. What the fuck is going on now? Excuse me. One second. Why? Did you mess with anything? 
SPEAKER4 0:29:32
Uh. Not since you have. 
SPEAKER3 0:29:36
Okay. Well. 
SPEAKER6 0:29:38
That ability is going up. So. Anyways. We're gonna smack the shit out of this motherfucker again. 
SPEAKER3 0:29:42
Doodly-doo. My weapon's not on my hotbar. With the 
SPEAKER5 0:29:52
pale swoop of the blade, Michi 
SPEAKER6 0:29:54
lunges at the guy one more time. 
SPEAKER3 0:29:58
Does that hit? 
SPEAKER6 0:30:00
I don't know why I'm not rolling for fucking 
SPEAKER3 0:30:02
attack first. Nope. I didn't hit. Sorry. Ignore that. 
SPEAKER4 0:30:10
Okay. Alright. 
SPEAKER6 0:30:14
I rolled a 12 apparently. I'm set to automatic. I don't know what's going on with that. 
SPEAKER3 0:30:18
Kinda tilting. 
SPEAKER6 0:30:20
Kinda tilting. But anyways. 
SPEAKER3 0:30:22
Michi lunges 
SPEAKER1 0:30:24
at the fucking roper. Attempting to swap at it. 
SPEAKER5 0:30:28
But just ends up hitting the ground 
SPEAKER1 0:30:30
and just shuddering. Hit the ground. 
SPEAKER5 0:30:36
You're shuddering as your sword has impacted 
SPEAKER1 0:30:38
the cold stone. You know. Nice review. Um. And you are 
SPEAKER5 0:30:44
none the better 
SPEAKER1 0:30:46
for having tried to strike it as much as possible. At the end of your turn, it is Horde's turn. Horde is going to call the axe back and for once be a bit cautious. I'm gonna be a bit cautious. 
SPEAKER5 0:30:58
It's going to move forward this way. And it's going to throw again. 
SPEAKER1 0:31:02
Go in again. 
SPEAKER5 0:31:08
And that's gonna be another miss. 
SPEAKER1 0:31:12
Is that auto rolling for you? It is also auto rolling. Hmm. Okay. Um. Michi's going to throw. He's going to miss. 
SPEAKER5 0:31:24
The axe is... This time it lands short 
SPEAKER1 0:31:26
as the strength of his arch-veils of rage also begins to wear off the wave. 
SPEAKER3 0:31:30
He's trying. 
SPEAKER1 0:31:32
He's not doing that much. He tries to the roper's turn. He's going to take 
SPEAKER5 0:31:44
four more attacks. 
SPEAKER1 0:31:46
One at Sangam. One at Horde. And one at Jizor. So. We'll start with Sangam. I need to know. That's a 24 hit. Oh. Oh. Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 0:32:06
Oh wait, I can use the reaction cutting words. 
SPEAKER1 0:32:08
Um. 
SPEAKER5 0:32:10
Can you? That's what the pop-up says. I'm gonna do that. And scream, in the voice of like a panicked 
SPEAKER1 0:32:18
jizor. 
SPEAKER2 0:32:20
Like, you prudish whore. 
SPEAKER1 0:32:22
Um. While pointing accusingly at the roper. Okay. One, two, three. Three, two, three. 
SPEAKER5 0:32:34
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:32:36
Roll your bardic inspiration die to check and I will have you subtract that from the attack. 
SPEAKER5 0:32:40
Oh. Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:32:42
Uh. 
SPEAKER5 0:32:44
I must target a token. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:32:46
One second. Let me. Yep. 
SPEAKER5 0:32:52
Trying to target it is just being a little annoying. It's not showing that it's like so- 
SPEAKER1 0:32:58
Oh wait. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:33:00
Here we go. 
SPEAKER1 0:33:02
Wait. Did it not do it? What you've done is you've inspired it. You just inspired the roper. Oh fuck. Wait. No, no, no. That's not. Definitely not the- 
SPEAKER2 0:33:14
That's okay. That's okay. My brother. He wanted to kill us faster. Just roll the dice itself. Okay. Um. 
SPEAKER5 0:33:24
Which. It's a d20. Or d1. Yeah. Okay. So d1 is six. 
SPEAKER1 0:33:34
Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:33:38
Oh god. 
SPEAKER5 0:33:40
Sorry. 
SPEAKER3 0:33:44
Had a brain fart. It's all good. 
SPEAKER2 0:33:48
Shit. I can't even type either today. 
SPEAKER3 0:33:50
Oh. 
SPEAKER4 0:33:52
So does 22 hit? 
SPEAKER3 0:33:54
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:33:56
Cool. You're still roped. Um. 
SPEAKER3 0:34:00
Michi. Hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:34:02
Uh. Does a 25 hit? It does. 
SPEAKER4 0:34:06
I guess 25. 
SPEAKER3 0:34:08
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 0:34:10
Okay. Cool. I get 25. Yep. 
SPEAKER4 0:34:16
Plus seven. Cool. 
SPEAKER1 0:34:18
Just checking. 
SPEAKER4 0:34:20
Making sure. You are so. In Songhun. You are now restrained. 
SPEAKER1 0:34:28
Grab your weapon. 
SPEAKER5 0:34:30
And you are now. 
SPEAKER4 0:34:32
Grappling the string. 
SPEAKER5 0:34:34
You. You. 
SPEAKER4 0:34:36
Grappled. And restrained. Ah. Wait a second. 
SPEAKER1 0:34:44
Um. Michi. You are also grappled with the string. I will have to take the target ores next. Uh. This is 17 hit. I believe it counts. Actually. 
SPEAKER5 0:34:56
I think it's a 17 hit. I believe it counts. 
SPEAKER1 0:35:00
I believe it counts. I believe it counts. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. His armor class is 17 right? Yeah. So it won't. Uh. That one is. No. His armor class is 14. What? No. 
SPEAKER5 0:35:26
No it's not. His character sheet is armor class 17. 
SPEAKER2 0:35:30
Uh. Let me double check that. 
SPEAKER5 0:35:32
Are you sure? 
SPEAKER1 0:35:34
I feel like you should be wearing more armor. 
SPEAKER5 0:35:36
He should be. 
SPEAKER1 0:35:38
Like I think Gizzard's base armor class. 
SPEAKER5 0:35:40
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:35:42
Let me double check that. There's no way that's correct. That might have been when I was updating sheets. That it didn't get processed correctly. 
SPEAKER5 0:35:54
That's okay. I think it won't hit anyway. 
SPEAKER1 0:35:58
But Gizzard. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:00
Actually also gonna go. 
SPEAKER3 0:36:02
So. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:04
Hit me. 
SPEAKER3 0:36:06
Does a 13 hit? 
SPEAKER6 0:36:08
Nope. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:10
God damn it. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:12
Ward has an armor class of 16. Okay. So Ward is hit as well. Cool. 
SPEAKER6 0:36:18
Grapple 10 restraint. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:20
Let me go even further back and make sure that's correct. Let me go even further back and make sure that's correct. Yes. He has 16. I will resolve his character sheet now. Because there's no reason for that. There. It's been updated. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:42
There. It's been updated. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:44
Cool. I guess they're gonna go with restraint. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:56
I guess they're gonna go with restraint. 
SPEAKER6 0:36:58
That is correct. 
SPEAKER1 0:37:00
That is correct. Right. Right. Okay. Restraint is bottom left side. Restraint is bottom left side. Restraint is bottom left side. Bottom left or left seat? When you open the character sheet. And it will affect bottom left. Oh. Okay. Okay. Take care. 
SPEAKER2 0:37:24
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:37:26
The icon wasn't showing the right way out. But. Use grapple restraint. You are also grapple restraint. And. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Cool. Then it's going to use real on. Then it's going to use real on. Each you have to try and hit. Let's go to community. Ward is hit. Yeah. The dog's dead too. Oh yes. Both dogs are hit. Yes. That'll have to work. You can really win and you can spike attack on you. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:10
Does it 24 hit? 
SPEAKER3 0:38:12
It does. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:14
Cool. Take 29 points of damage. 
SPEAKER3 0:38:18
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:38:20
Let me. Double check something. Okay. 29 you say? 
SPEAKER5 0:38:28
Yep. 29. 
SPEAKER6 0:38:30
I think you already applied that. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:32
Because I was at full HP. 
SPEAKER5 0:38:34
Yeah. It might have already applied. 
SPEAKER1 0:38:36
But it actually targeted. 
SPEAKER5 0:38:38
Cool. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:40
At the end of its turn. 
SPEAKER5 0:38:42
It's not going to. You are up. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:44
You've just seen this tentacle. 
SPEAKER5 0:38:46
These four tentacles reach out. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:48
You are now grappled. You've seen one go for Michi. 
SPEAKER5 0:38:52
You don't know the one behind you that you're prone. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:54
But it's looking. You saw Michi just get dragged forward and then crunched. 
SPEAKER5 0:38:58
As it shoved it in its maw. 
SPEAKER4 0:39:00
And then bit through half of it. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:02
Um. 
SPEAKER2 0:39:04
Can I. 
SPEAKER4 0:39:06
You are laying in a pool of blood. Dog's blood. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:10
Chikin's blood. Now Michi's blood. Oh. Um. 
SPEAKER6 0:39:18
Um. 
SPEAKER5 0:39:20
Calm emotions wouldn't work on this thing right? Because it's a. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:26
Humanoid. 
SPEAKER5 0:39:28
But it also mentions creature. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:30
Um. 
SPEAKER2 0:39:32
Nevermind I don't have that. 
SPEAKER5 0:39:34
Uh. Isanghan is going to. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:38
Can he use his. Inspiration. 
SPEAKER5 0:39:42
On himself. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:44
And then try to use strength to get out. Of the tentacles. Is it an action to inspire? 
SPEAKER5 0:39:50
You can inspire yourself once. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:52
It's a bonus action. Okay. Good to go. How do I. Wait. Target myself. Target myself. I think. 
SPEAKER5 0:40:16
I think. 
SPEAKER2 0:40:18
I did it. Question mark. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:24
Um. 
SPEAKER5 0:40:26
And then he's going to try to roll. Strength. 
SPEAKER2 0:40:30
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:32
To get out. 
SPEAKER2 0:40:34
Uh. 
SPEAKER5 0:40:36
I go again. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:38
I have advantage on this because of that right? 
SPEAKER2 0:40:40
So I can roll one more time. 
SPEAKER5 0:40:42
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:44
I thought. Wait. Okay. I'm going to try to. 
SPEAKER3 0:40:52
I'm going to try to. 
SPEAKER4 0:40:54
Also your body. 
SPEAKER2 0:40:56
Oh. I thought it said D6 for level. 
SPEAKER5 0:41:00
Oh we're six. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:02
I don't know why I kept thinking we're below level four. 
SPEAKER2 0:41:04
Shit. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:06
Okay. Sorry. I was thinking. Um. Oh. 
SPEAKER5 0:41:16
No. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:18
Uh. Yeah. He's not going to make it out of that. Even if. Even with the inspiration I think. Okay. Anything else in your turn? 
SPEAKER3 0:41:32
Uh. 
SPEAKER2 0:41:34
He's going to flail dramatically. Uh. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:38
Cry. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:41:42
At the end of your turn four if you are up. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:44
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:41:46
Okay. I am going to shoot it again. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:50
I am going to shoot it again. No. Like that. I don't know how this works. 
SPEAKER2 0:42:00
Um. 
SPEAKER5 0:42:02
Eighteen. 
SPEAKER1 0:42:04
Still will not hit. Still will not hit. How would you describe our basis? How would you describe our basis? I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER2 0:42:14
You cut out. 
SPEAKER1 0:42:16
What happened? 
SPEAKER5 0:42:18
He did not beat the armor class but you can describe how it exists. 
SPEAKER1 0:42:20
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 0:42:22
Oh. Um. It eats it, I guess. 
SPEAKER4 0:42:28
Alright. 
SPEAKER5 0:42:30
A shimmering bolt of lightning encoded in a rusted arrow 
SPEAKER1 0:42:32
cheats directly into this thing's moment and it just tastes like a snack. 
SPEAKER5 0:42:42
Anything else in your turn four? 
SPEAKER1 0:42:44
Anything else in your turn four? Anything else in your turn four? Anything else in your turn four? Anything else in your turn four? 
SPEAKER2 0:42:52
Um. You keep cutting out. Sorry. No. 
SPEAKER5 0:42:58
That's all I can do. 
SPEAKER4 0:43:00
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:02
And Gizzard you are up. 
SPEAKER5 0:43:04
I... I don't know how you could have possibly guessed that 
SPEAKER1 0:43:08
Chill Touch is coming. Now Gizzard's gonna 
SPEAKER5 0:43:12
prop himself up a bit. Maybe try standing up if that doesn't take an entire turn. 
SPEAKER4 0:43:16
Maybe try standing up if that doesn't take an entire turn. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:18
No, it takes half your movement. 
SPEAKER5 0:43:20
Gizzard will stand back up. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:22
Go for another dramatic Chill Touch pose. And look for the proper set 
SPEAKER5 0:43:28
of pushing buttons that makes Chill Touch happen. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:30
of pushing buttons that makes Chill Touch happen. Um. Attack. Attack. 
SPEAKER5 0:43:38
Aight. 24. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:42
That will do it. Alright. 
SPEAKER5 0:43:46
Man, I live for actually hitting something. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:48
Man, I live for actually hitting something. 
SPEAKER5 0:43:50
Oh, my dice are colorful. That's five damage right there. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:54
Five big ones. 
SPEAKER6 0:43:56
Five big ones. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:58
I reach out. The... 
SPEAKER5 0:44:02
Skeletal hand of whatever necrotic damage bullshit 
SPEAKER1 0:44:06
emerges and just kinda 
SPEAKER5 0:44:10
gently pets 
SPEAKER1 0:44:12
the roper. But viciously. 
SPEAKER5 0:44:16
Heavy petting. 
SPEAKER1 0:44:18
Come out and just stroke the back half of the roper. A necrotic black anger 
SPEAKER5 0:44:24
that encases everywhere the hand gets punched. 
SPEAKER1 0:44:26
As it shudders in space. It's taking damage, but you can't tell 
SPEAKER4 0:44:30
how badly it's gonna hurt. 
SPEAKER3 0:44:32
Hm. 
SPEAKER1 0:44:36
Which brings us to Michi. 
SPEAKER4 0:44:38
Yeah? What are you up to? 
SPEAKER1 0:44:40
Well then, I guess I'm gonna roll for my Fire Breath on this one. With a big in-in-in. Hail Michi's gonna look at this bastard and just kinda spit on him in a way. 
SPEAKER5 0:44:52
It's his fire breath 
SPEAKER1 0:44:54
out of her. Uh, that's gonna be 4d6. Damn right. Right in its fuckin' face. Right into its mouth. Give it a nice taste of its own medicine. Uh, you got a spell save. Uh, not a spell save, but you have a dexterity save 13. By the way. Dex. Ah, that's great. That's a great, 
SPEAKER5 0:45:22
that's a great roll that I have here. Uh, that'll wait. There's more. That's a zero. I'm gonna put you to sleep 
SPEAKER1 0:45:28
maybe after that. 
SPEAKER5 0:45:32
Yeah, no, the roper rolled a zero 
SPEAKER1 0:45:34
for the next 30 seconds. That's 18 points of fire damage. 
SPEAKER4 0:45:36
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:45:38
Scorch the ever-loving 
SPEAKER5 0:45:40
fuck out of this thing, 
SPEAKER1 0:45:42
as it can't really move or dodge out of the way, and so it just tries to stay there and tank it. Yellow glowing eyed Michi feeding yours and burn away the outer flesh of the bottom half of this creature. 
SPEAKER4 0:45:56
Michi's gonna 
SPEAKER5 0:45:58
grin at it. 
SPEAKER1 0:46:00
But wait, there's more! 
SPEAKER5 0:46:02
And Michi's just gonna say 
SPEAKER1 0:46:04
in a weird tone, just staring at this guy, one second please. I got something for this. How do you know it's a manhandle? Whatever the fuck it is, I'm gonna tell this motherfucker to sleep. Tentacle genitals? You're cast asleep. Using the right. 
SPEAKER2 0:46:28
That was horrifying. 
SPEAKER5 0:46:30
No, bonus action is that you're using a potion. 
SPEAKER2 0:46:36
That was stupid! You don't like the witch from Adventure Time? No, it's horrifying! That was dumb! 
SPEAKER5 0:46:46
That was beautiful, thank you. 
SPEAKER2 0:46:48
I ate it! That was pretty good. 
SPEAKER1 0:46:52
Hold on a second, I gotta find it. I'm eating dinner at the same time. 
SPEAKER2 0:46:58
Uh, da da da da da da da, Everything's cutting in and out, and I just heard a very deep voice say, sleep. 
SPEAKER5 0:47:04
Yes. 
SPEAKER2 0:47:06
Uh, 
SPEAKER5 0:47:08
Can you read this shit? 
SPEAKER6 0:47:10
Cause I'm not seeing it in there for it's save. 
SPEAKER1 0:47:12
I think you just, you dead? Hmm. 
SPEAKER5 0:47:16
It's the sleep spell, right? 
SPEAKER1 0:47:18
Uh, Yeah, I believe that could be it. 
SPEAKER5 0:47:24
With the sleep spell you have to roll, 
SPEAKER4 0:47:26
I do not remember what dice you have to roll, you have to roll higher than the hit points it has. 
SPEAKER1 0:47:30
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER6 0:47:32
I got you. I'm gonna target this thing and then 
SPEAKER1 0:47:34
roll sleep now. 
SPEAKER6 0:47:38
Uh, it's gonna be at a first level. 
SPEAKER1 0:47:40
First level. I 
SPEAKER5 0:47:44
It is, yep, first level enchantment. 
SPEAKER1 0:47:46
That is 5d8. 
SPEAKER6 0:47:48
Wait, why is it a an area of effect? I thought it was a targeted 
SPEAKER1 0:47:52
Hold on. 
SPEAKER4 0:47:54
It is, creatures within 20p feet of the point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of current hit points. Ignoring unconscious creatures. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:02
Then I'm gonna put it 
SPEAKER6 0:48:06
there. 
SPEAKER4 0:48:08
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 0:48:16
It rolls for 30. 
SPEAKER5 0:48:18
That is off the map. 
SPEAKER1 0:48:22
Doesn't have to be on the person though, either. 
SPEAKER4 0:48:24
No, it's just 
SPEAKER5 0:48:26
within 20 feet of the point you choose within range. I'm aiming up at the 
SPEAKER6 0:48:30
roof away from it, just enough to get it in range. 
SPEAKER2 0:48:32
You know what, I'll let that happen. I'll let that happen. 
SPEAKER4 0:48:34
Sure. Roll 5d8. I did. I did. That's 30. 30 is not above the 
SPEAKER1 0:48:44
Well, yep. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:46
Then I pass my 
SPEAKER6 0:48:48
turn. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:50
Alright. 
SPEAKER4 0:48:52
That ends your turn. 
SPEAKER6 0:48:54
Moving onwards. 
SPEAKER1 0:48:56
Bord is going to 
SPEAKER3 0:48:58
throw another axe. 
SPEAKER1 0:49:02
Actually, Bord is gonna go ahead and try 
SPEAKER5 0:49:06
and break free of the tentacle from the front of the tentacle. 
SPEAKER1 0:49:10
He has health. He's gonna strike check. 
SPEAKER4 0:49:14
And that will work. 
SPEAKER1 0:49:16
19. 
SPEAKER4 0:49:18
So he's gonna spend his action struggling. 
SPEAKER5 0:49:20
Having recently met his end 
SPEAKER1 0:49:22
at one of the core. So, Bord finally escaping the tether. 
SPEAKER4 0:49:26
Using the axe to hack away at the 
SPEAKER5 0:49:28
tentacle that is wrapped around the wings. 
SPEAKER4 0:49:30
That's gonna be 
SPEAKER1 0:49:32
his turn. Then comes Grover's turn. Grover is going to go ahead and make another... 
SPEAKER5 0:49:38
More attacks of time. He's gonna go after Bord and 
SPEAKER1 0:49:42
Jizzer. Two that I can see that hasn't hit yet. 
SPEAKER5 0:49:52
Jizzer does a 27 hit. Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:49:56
Cool. You are grappled and restrained. Hell yeah. 
SPEAKER5 0:50:02
He's a brand new B. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:06
He's gonna go after 
SPEAKER5 0:50:08
the tentacle. 
SPEAKER3 0:50:10
Reel me in, coach. 
SPEAKER4 0:50:12
He grapples Bord again. With the last tentacle 
SPEAKER3 0:50:16
that it has free. 
SPEAKER5 0:50:18
Then, he is going to go ahead 
SPEAKER4 0:50:20
and use his bite attack on the one who's done the most damage to it so far. 
SPEAKER6 0:50:24
Mishi. I need five damage. 
SPEAKER5 0:50:28
He's going to use his bite attack against you. 
SPEAKER4 0:50:30
He's a 13 hit. No. Fuck off, Mishi. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:34
You are... 
SPEAKER5 0:50:36
Speeding on its face, wiggling and struggling as it is trying to shove you 
SPEAKER4 0:50:40
into the maw of stony 
SPEAKER1 0:50:42
sharp teeth 
SPEAKER4 0:50:44
that extend in front of you. It is also 
SPEAKER1 0:50:48
going to use its reel. 
SPEAKER4 0:50:50
Reel in the other person you did the damage to. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:52
Which isn't close to him. 
SPEAKER5 0:50:54
And that's going to be you, Jizzer. You're real. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:58
Let's see. 25 feet. That is five. And 15. 25. We got one spell slot. 
SPEAKER6 0:51:08
This bitch's name is right on it. 
SPEAKER4 0:51:10
Alright. Cool. That's going to be the end of Yit's turn. Isanghang. You are up. 
SPEAKER2 0:51:16
Um... 
SPEAKER1 0:51:18
I guess so 
SPEAKER2 0:51:20
Isanghang's kind of reeled in close to this 
SPEAKER1 0:51:22
thing, right? Um... 
SPEAKER5 0:51:26
Could I try splashing some of 
SPEAKER2 0:51:30
my oil on its face 
SPEAKER5 0:51:32
towards its eye and then trying to stab it with my lightning rapier in its eyeball or face area? I'll aim for the eyeball. 
SPEAKER1 0:51:42
So, 
SPEAKER5 0:51:44
if you're going to use the oil, 
SPEAKER4 0:51:46
throw it as an authorized weapon. 
SPEAKER5 0:51:48
That will take your action, or stabbing it will take your action. 
SPEAKER1 0:51:50
You can't do both. 
SPEAKER5 0:51:52
However, DM to player. If you hit it with a 
SPEAKER1 0:51:56
vial of oil, you can then light it on fire, and it will take fire damage over time. 
SPEAKER2 0:52:02
I don't... 
SPEAKER1 0:52:04
Oh no, I do have a... I have a lamp that would be like an action to throw it at. You also have a fire dragon around you at all times. 
SPEAKER5 0:52:14
Does he have any more 
SPEAKER3 0:52:16
fire left in him? 
SPEAKER2 0:52:20
One spell slot left. I got one. Do you have a fire dragon? I'm gonna... 
SPEAKER6 0:52:26
Not really, but close enough. 
SPEAKER5 0:52:28
I'm ready. 
SPEAKER2 0:52:34
I'm gonna oil up this slab 
SPEAKER5 0:52:36
and try to hit its eye. 
SPEAKER2 0:52:38
Oil in the eye. Pocket oil. 
SPEAKER4 0:52:40
Pocket oil? 
SPEAKER5 0:52:42
Okay. Uh, how do I... How do I, like, throw... 
SPEAKER2 0:52:50
Wait, no, I do need to lock it. Oh, shit. 
SPEAKER1 0:52:52
Uh... 
SPEAKER5 0:52:54
How do I, like... 
SPEAKER6 0:52:56
I equipped the oil. 
SPEAKER2 0:52:58
I equipped the oil. 
SPEAKER6 0:53:00
Yeah, click the monsters you do a spell, like, as a target, and then throw it at it. I'm expecting it again. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:08
Didn't mean to oil myself up, my bad. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:10
Oh! 
SPEAKER6 0:53:12
You are lube. 
SPEAKER5 0:53:14
Good to go. Okay. Did I... 
SPEAKER4 0:53:22
That effect lube has been applied. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:24
I oil it up? 
SPEAKER5 0:53:26
I mean, even if it doesn't reflect in game, 
SPEAKER6 0:53:28
I will recognize the roper as oil. One second, I gotta fuck my head with it. Me too, he's gonna look back 
SPEAKER5 0:53:34
and be like, bird. Fucking oil! 
SPEAKER2 0:53:36
Are you kidding me? What are you trying to get ready for, Gizzard? 
SPEAKER5 0:53:40
Uh... 
SPEAKER6 0:53:42
Right for the... 
SPEAKER1 0:53:44
Alright, it is oiled. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:46
Isonghun's gonna look 
SPEAKER1 0:53:48
at, um... Uh... 
SPEAKER5 0:53:52
Isonghun's gonna look at, uh... 
SPEAKER1 0:53:54
Michi, like... 
SPEAKER2 0:53:56
Not the bird with it's face up, but the 
SPEAKER1 0:53:58
second one. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:00
Michi is just gonna fucking be like, Are you... 
SPEAKER2 0:54:04
Are you kidding me? You know that thing on your fucking hip? That pointy little stick could kill something! I don't know, try it out once in a while. 
SPEAKER6 0:54:12
Maybe. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:14
Just a little bit, please? He's gonna use it. You just have to oil it up first. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:22
That's what she said. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:24
Michi's gonna give that fucking 
SPEAKER6 0:54:26
retarded person look, just like, I just lost all my brain cells with this. I'd love to stab him, 
SPEAKER1 0:54:32
but we need lube first. Oh... It's... It's summer. That'll lube before you poke. 
SPEAKER4 0:54:44
So, you lube up the 
SPEAKER5 0:54:46
broker, and then is that any... 
SPEAKER4 0:54:48
Are you going to try and do anything else on your turn? 
SPEAKER2 0:54:50
Uh... He's going to... 
SPEAKER3 0:54:54
Point at Jizzard... 
SPEAKER2 0:54:58
And throw down the 
SPEAKER6 0:55:00
empty cup of oil. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:02
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:55:04
Alright, end of your turn. Top the next round. Forrest, you are up. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:10
Um, something just happened there. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:14
Hey, sure if you can hear me, I'm gonna shoot it again. Right back. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:22
If I can figure out how the targeting works... The little bullseye top left side, click it. Then select target. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:30
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:55:32
I thought it was like a pinging button, that's why I got confused. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:34
Yeah, it's dumb that it's like that, but... 
SPEAKER2 0:55:36
That's boundary for you. That is six! 
SPEAKER5 0:55:40
Apparently... 
SPEAKER2 0:55:42
Hear me? But apparently my bow has as much ping as I do. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:46
So... 
SPEAKER2 0:55:48
That's a whole ass man. Yup. This is so much... 
SPEAKER5 0:55:54
So Forrest is now 
SPEAKER1 0:55:56
experiencing a fucking CSGO 
SPEAKER4 0:55:58
at 400 ping bow. 
SPEAKER2 0:56:00
Forrest is now... 
SPEAKER4 0:56:02
You look at your bow, and you realize... 
SPEAKER2 0:56:04
I'm between 1300 and 5000. It's an experience. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:08
Goddamn. 
SPEAKER5 0:56:12
Forrest has the AWP. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:14
However, cannot hit 
SPEAKER5 0:56:16
his shit in the face, because everything is teleported. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:22
Is there anything else I can do for your turn? 
SPEAKER2 0:56:26
I cannot do anything else with... my turn, unfortunately. 
SPEAKER5 0:56:32
I'm gonna do it with my turn. 
SPEAKER2 0:56:34
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:56:36
Yeah. Alright. 
SPEAKER6 0:56:40
Gizzard knows an oil tentacle when he sees one. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:42
And we'll... 
SPEAKER5 0:56:44
Ah shit, like, what kind of position am I in, in being roped? Am I, like, close enough? Uh, I can't... 
SPEAKER4 0:56:52
Okay, so I'm not moving tokens over each other, 
SPEAKER5 0:56:54
um, in front of this roper, but you are 
SPEAKER1 0:56:56
essentially where Michi is, but like, 
SPEAKER4 0:56:58
here. 
SPEAKER5 0:57:00
Gotcha. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:57:02
Thanks. 
SPEAKER5 0:57:04
To put Gizzard there, you're not actually 
SPEAKER1 0:57:06
in this spot, but I'm putting you there 
SPEAKER4 0:57:08
as a representation. 
SPEAKER2 0:57:10
I'm not looking at the computer screen, I'm currently... packing. 
SPEAKER1 0:57:14
This is just what Gizzard needed. Gizzard shall, uh, use 
SPEAKER5 0:57:18
his very last spell slot, 
SPEAKER1 0:57:20
if I can figure out how to button again. Uh, shit. Um... 
SPEAKER3 0:57:26
And use, 
SPEAKER6 0:57:28
uh, on this very much 
SPEAKER5 0:57:30
oiled, uh, roper, uh, Burning Hands, 
SPEAKER1 0:57:34
uh, if I can... Uh, if I can... 
SPEAKER5 0:57:40
Yeah! Let's light this candle! 
SPEAKER1 0:57:42
How do I...? Oh, I have to give myself a thing and then use it. Okay. Uh, fuck. Uh... Gizzard. Jesus Christ. Gizzard. How? I got the roper. 
SPEAKER5 0:57:58
I'm trying. 
SPEAKER2 0:58:00
I'm hitting the Burning Hands button 
SPEAKER5 0:58:02
and it's... Oh, god. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:04
I'm trying to use. Okay. Uh, uh... Cast spell. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:58:12
Plus a 15-foot cone, so that it won't matter too much anyway. Don't worry about it. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:16
Um, basically I need to make a dexterity saving throw, which, as we all know, I am simply the best at 
SPEAKER5 0:58:20
as a roper. That is a 12 for all the tentacles. All the tentacles. Oh, shit. Yes. I'm gonna say 12 counts for all of them. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:28
Do they... Do they... Do they lose? 
SPEAKER5 0:58:32
Uh, that is 12 for all damage. They do lose. Roll damage. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:36
Uh... 12. 
SPEAKER5 0:58:40
Alright, another 12 damage. 
SPEAKER4 0:58:42
Let's see. How much damage? 
SPEAKER5 0:58:44
I'm very much using a fire spell and it's very much oiled. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:48
Uh... Roper. I'm gonna need a beer after this. 
SPEAKER5 0:58:54
As you slap your hands together and say, Alright, what does Gizzard say? 
SPEAKER1 0:58:58
Vocalize your deal. He just screams. He just screams. 
SPEAKER5 0:59:04
See the screaming of the dragonborn 
SPEAKER4 0:59:06
as their head back, arms forward, 
SPEAKER1 0:59:08
jet of fire erupts from them. jet of fire erupts from them. All of the tendrils that currently have each and every one of you grasped are instantly immolated and burst. 
SPEAKER5 0:59:16
are instantly immolated and burst. 
SPEAKER4 0:59:18
Coating the ground in this flaming goo. 
SPEAKER5 0:59:20
The creature itself, for the second time in 30 seconds, 
SPEAKER1 0:59:24
for the second time in 30 seconds, 
SPEAKER5 0:59:26
has a gout of fire pointed directly at it and just burns from the bottom down. 
SPEAKER1 0:59:30
and just burns from the bottom down. Doesn't look fucked up, 
SPEAKER5 0:59:34
but it does look not great. 
SPEAKER1 0:59:36
So, I... 
SPEAKER2 0:59:38
Question. Are you trying to spot shit really hitting the eye? 
SPEAKER5 0:59:40
Question. Are you trying to spot shit really hitting the eye? Does that affect the vision in that one? 
SPEAKER1 0:59:44
As the flames decide to dispel, the flames then creep, and you see all of the parts that were 
SPEAKER4 0:59:50
wicked with the oil 
SPEAKER1 0:59:52
that didn't immediately go up 
SPEAKER5 0:59:54
when the fire was casted, 
SPEAKER1 0:59:56
but are now getting targeted by all the embers 
SPEAKER5 1:00:00
and the remaining flame. All of them 
SPEAKER1 1:00:02
are going to catch, and the creature becomes this flaming stone, 
SPEAKER5 1:00:06
almost monument, 
SPEAKER1 1:00:08
as it screams in the space around it. Hmm? Hell yeah. 
SPEAKER5 1:00:12
Bam. Fire dragon. 
SPEAKER4 1:00:14
Bam. Bam. 
SPEAKER5 1:00:16
Get fire dragon! That's what it says. 
SPEAKER1 1:00:20
After screaming. 
SPEAKER5 1:00:22
Okay. It's starting to look 
SPEAKER1 1:00:24
a little bit worse for where it happened. 
SPEAKER5 1:00:28
It's not had a great day. The carapace are burning and coming off. Some of the softer flesh underneath 
SPEAKER1 1:00:34
is now peeking through. 
SPEAKER5 1:00:36
The eye itself is burning 
SPEAKER1 1:00:38
and scorched, and you can tell that 
SPEAKER5 1:00:40
the skin on the outside, the clear film 
SPEAKER1 1:00:42
on those eyes starts to crackle and bubble away. Eww. 
SPEAKER5 1:00:50
That is your turn, Joseph. 
SPEAKER1 1:00:52
Yep. Yep. Michi, you're up. Oh, Michi's turn again, huh? Hmm. All right. Then I'm going to go ahead and... I'm going to toll this motherfucker to dead end. All right. Michi's just going to clink her fucking sword as if it was a bell itself, just to get the echoing sound. Bam. 
SPEAKER5 1:01:16
Bam. One second. 
SPEAKER4 1:01:20
Oh, I got 
SPEAKER5 1:01:22
bardic inspiration from that, so I'm going to use it. Okay. Looks like that shit hit. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:30
Oof. Mmm. And, uh, 
SPEAKER5 1:01:38
with that, I'm going to take a 
SPEAKER1 1:01:40
moment to get out of my mind. 
SPEAKER5 1:01:42
Michi just takes a deep breath 
SPEAKER6 1:01:44
and is like, 
SPEAKER5 1:01:46
stupidly enough, 
SPEAKER6 1:01:48
like, uh, what do they call that shit? Somebody remember Tanjiro? He does it for 
SPEAKER4 1:01:52
fucking deep breathing. 
SPEAKER6 1:01:54
We're just doing healing. Fuck it. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:56
Second wind. 
SPEAKER4 1:01:58
All right. 
SPEAKER2 1:02:00
But with that, because it's a... I still have vitality going, and it's a full tan. 
SPEAKER3 1:02:04
Bet. All right. We're back in this. 
SPEAKER5 1:02:12
The creature, as the sound of the spell 
SPEAKER4 1:02:14
fills and echoes the caverns, see blood gurgle from its mouth. The eye itself now bursts 
SPEAKER5 1:02:20
in front of it. 
SPEAKER6 1:02:22
It looks 
SPEAKER4 1:02:24
fucking awful. However, 
SPEAKER5 1:02:26
it also looks like it is 
SPEAKER4 1:02:28
still going to be a bit of a problem. It is bloody. But the next up, Bored. 
SPEAKER5 1:02:38
Bored is... Let me go ahead and clear the 
SPEAKER4 1:02:42
status effects off of it. Yoink. Yoink. 
SPEAKER5 1:02:46
Roper Slayer. 
SPEAKER6 1:02:48
And then Death Slade. 
SPEAKER3 1:02:54
Uh, out of character, 
SPEAKER6 1:02:56
can you use an action and a bonus action if it's the same item? 
SPEAKER4 1:03:00
Um... What do you mean? 
SPEAKER5 1:03:04
Potion. 
SPEAKER1 1:03:08
Yes, you could take a potion as an action. 
SPEAKER3 1:03:10
And a bonus action in the same roll. 
SPEAKER5 1:03:16
Wait a second. 
SPEAKER1 1:03:20
Give me a second. You might like that. 
SPEAKER4 1:03:24
It's just a... 
SPEAKER1 1:03:28
Two... By the way, good call on that body inspiration, my little bird. 
SPEAKER6 1:03:34
Not even joking, I was like one off on an action, y'know? 
SPEAKER5 1:03:38
I'm going to say because he is... 
SPEAKER3 1:03:40
Because using a potion 
SPEAKER1 1:03:42
is a bonus action. Action. I'm going to say because he is... Because using a potion is a bonus action. Action. I'm going to say because he is... 
SPEAKER5 1:03:56
Because using a potion 
SPEAKER1 1:03:58
is a bonus action. Action. I'm going to say because he is... Because using a potion is a bonus action. Action. Sure. Sure, I'll let that happen. Needed. Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:04:20
What do you, uh... 
SPEAKER4 1:04:22
It's Orr's turn. He is going to go ahead. 
SPEAKER3 1:04:24
He's going to throw an axe. 
SPEAKER6 1:04:28
Because he is, uh... 
SPEAKER1 1:04:30
Nah, I'm fucking getting 
SPEAKER4 1:04:32
a little bit too close to that. 
SPEAKER1 1:04:34
This time, the axe, 
SPEAKER5 1:04:36
it spins the air, it hits the feature where the eye 
SPEAKER4 1:04:40
should have been. But because the eye is not there, it just hits the stony outer carapace that almost acts as the eyelid or eye cover, 
SPEAKER1 1:04:48
behind where it is in the follow-up function. 
SPEAKER4 1:04:50
It bounces up and then the axe is lighter, so it's 
SPEAKER1 1:04:52
going to have to do a finish. And he gets to do it. 
SPEAKER4 1:05:00
And now it's Roper's turn. 
SPEAKER5 1:05:02
Next. The Roper is going to take its turn to extrude 
SPEAKER1 1:05:06
another tentacle, and then immediately try to hit you with it. Actually, 
SPEAKER5 1:05:14
you guys both did damage to it. Michi and Jizzard. 
SPEAKER6 1:05:16
Michi, odds are even. 
SPEAKER4 1:05:18
I'm no even. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:05:22
Jizzard, please roll a d6. 
SPEAKER1 1:05:24
No, why do I have to roll a roll? Okay, hold on. Heh heh. Heh heh. Slash. Roll one d6. That's a 5-5. Two. Michi, it's going after you. Cool. 
SPEAKER5 1:05:42
Dumb bitch won't try my me. Uh, I suppose 16 won't hit? 
SPEAKER4 1:05:46
Nope. 
SPEAKER1 1:05:48
Alright. You see the tentacle whip out towards you 
SPEAKER5 1:05:50
wildly, but it can't see. So it's just kind of aiming at where you were 
SPEAKER1 1:05:54
in the space. It's not too hard to dodge the blade before it hits you. With that, it has 
SPEAKER5 1:06:02
no other real ability 
SPEAKER1 1:06:04
to hit you at the moment than when it hits turn. Which brings us to Isang Hong. You're up. 
SPEAKER2 1:06:14
Isang Hong's gonna stab at a fleshy bit with his lightning 
SPEAKER5 1:06:18
uh, rapier. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:20
Okay, go for it. Wait, um, 
SPEAKER2 1:06:28
did I still have the thing targeted? 
SPEAKER1 1:06:30
No. 
SPEAKER2 1:06:32
Oh, wait, uh... 
SPEAKER3 1:06:34
There you go. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:36
Uh, uh... Oh, yeah, I can still do 
SPEAKER5 1:06:40
barter? Oh. 
SPEAKER3 1:06:42
Yeah, it stays up for a while. 
SPEAKER2 1:06:44
Oh, okay. Oh! 
SPEAKER4 1:06:46
Yep. Yeah, that'll hit. That'll do it. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:52
He uses his 
SPEAKER5 1:06:54
mighty toothpick to poke at a fleshy bit and zap that shit. 
SPEAKER4 1:07:00
You see this exposed fleshy protrusion that is now pulsing out of the carcass itself. The pressure of the armor that this creature normally plays is not keeping its internal organs in space in its skull. And you stab through it, driving up to the hill. Please don't damage me. 
SPEAKER5 1:07:16
Okay. Oh, wait. 
SPEAKER3 1:07:18
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 1:07:22
Sorry, I'm trying to... 
SPEAKER5 1:07:24
Oh, oh, shit. That is a... 
SPEAKER1 1:07:30
It's the lightning one. 
SPEAKER2 1:07:32
It's the lightning one. It's 1d8. 
SPEAKER4 1:07:34
How... 
SPEAKER2 1:07:36
I'm trying to remember how to do the, uh... 
SPEAKER6 1:07:38
It should be 1d4. 
SPEAKER5 1:07:40
Wait, 1d8? 
SPEAKER4 1:07:42
For the piercing, right? 
SPEAKER2 1:07:44
And then... 
SPEAKER4 1:07:46
1d4 for lightning. 
SPEAKER1 1:07:48
Okay, so... 
SPEAKER5 1:07:50
So I'll roll an additional 
SPEAKER1 1:07:52
1d4? Okay. Okay. Okay. How's it looking? It's looking hurt. Pretty hurt, pretty bloody. 
SPEAKER5 1:08:06
But not like it's going to just perish the next... 
SPEAKER1 1:08:08
instant. Alright. 
SPEAKER5 1:08:14
Alright, anything else on your turn? 
SPEAKER1 1:08:16
Slow your movement, slow your bonus action. Uh... 
SPEAKER5 1:08:24
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 1:08:26
Yeah, I can't... 
SPEAKER5 1:08:28
That's about all for... 
SPEAKER1 1:08:30
No. 
SPEAKER4 1:08:32
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:08:34
Top of the round, Forrest, you're up. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:36
I'm gonna shoot it again! Shoot it again? 
SPEAKER5 1:08:46
I'm gonna fire into the mist. 
SPEAKER4 1:08:48
I'm gonna fire into the mist! 
SPEAKER2 1:08:52
That's all, folks! That's all, folks! 
SPEAKER1 1:08:56
Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:09:00
Um... Yeah, there's... There's nothing... I can do otherwise. 
SPEAKER4 1:09:08
Okay, I... 
SPEAKER2 1:09:10
I need to find a way to get two actions. I really do. 
SPEAKER3 1:09:14
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 1:09:16
Yeah. Or to have something else to attack with, or... 
SPEAKER2 1:09:20
Yeah, but... yeah. I mean, it's not yours, but... 
SPEAKER1 1:09:24
That's... That's not great for a C-cap. 
SPEAKER2 1:09:28
... tactically unwise at this point. 
SPEAKER4 1:09:30
And is, in fact, tactically unwise. 
SPEAKER1 1:09:32
And unwise. Yeah. But, at the end of your turn, 
SPEAKER5 1:09:38
Juicy, you're up. 
SPEAKER1 1:09:40
Oh, fuck, it's still so loud. Gotta make sure you're paying attention. Gotta make sure you're paying attention. Fine. Alright, alright. Oh, fuck, what'd I do? 
SPEAKER5 1:09:52
Okay, um... 
SPEAKER1 1:09:54
Alright, this bitch... 
SPEAKER5 1:09:56
Gonna... He felt the flames, and now he's gonna feel my chill... 
SPEAKER1 1:10:00
touch. Touch of the chill. Um... Like, scroll all the way up. 
SPEAKER5 1:10:08
Oh, there it is. 
SPEAKER2 1:10:10
Alright, it takes... 
SPEAKER1 1:10:12
25 hit. Uh, 25 will hit, actually. Fuck yeah. 
SPEAKER5 1:10:18
Alright. Feel the... Stay cool. 
SPEAKER1 1:10:22
Damage. 
SPEAKER5 1:10:24
Alright. Another Skeletal Hand... Actually, you describe what your spell does. Same thing. Just reach out this time. 
SPEAKER1 1:10:32
I say, stay cool. And, uh... 
SPEAKER5 1:10:36
You say, stay cool. And the little... The Skeletal Hand does kinda like... 
SPEAKER4 1:10:40
that little snap to a point finger, and then fires 
SPEAKER5 1:10:44
like a handgun. 
SPEAKER4 1:10:46
And this black beam of necrotic energy coats the creature as more parts of its stone exterior 
SPEAKER1 1:10:52
crumble off. And you can see the rocks and the literal essence of death creeping into the face of the missing child. He's now leaking 
SPEAKER5 1:11:04
this black blood that kind of pulses out of every gaming hole 
SPEAKER1 1:11:08
that has been put into it. Alright. 
SPEAKER5 1:11:14
Anything else you're doing on your turn? 
SPEAKER1 1:11:16
Nope. 
SPEAKER4 1:11:18
Amici, you are up. 
SPEAKER5 1:11:20
Is this thing still covered in oil? Can I see it? 
SPEAKER1 1:11:22
Isn't it on fire? 
SPEAKER5 1:11:24
Actually, yeah, it is still on fire. 
SPEAKER1 1:11:26
Let's take another... Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER5 1:11:30
Well, don't worry, because I'm about to add more to that. 
SPEAKER1 1:11:32
So you can add more. 
SPEAKER4 1:11:34
Okay, cool. 
SPEAKER5 1:11:36
But it is on fire, and it is still on fire. 
SPEAKER3 1:11:38
Yes. 
SPEAKER5 1:11:40
Amici's gonna jokingly look at Jizzard and be like, watch this. I can do it again. And he just blows into the dude's face. Mocking Jizzard as she does. And take another... Potion of fire breath in. No, no. I have three freaking uses of it. Oh, fucking Christ. That's another 15 to entertain it. Yep. 
SPEAKER1 1:12:02
You burn 
SPEAKER5 1:12:04
the ever-loving shit 
SPEAKER1 1:12:06
out of this thing, as it screeches 
SPEAKER4 1:12:08
into space, the two chambers that it has 
SPEAKER5 1:12:10
flare and burn away. The shell is all but gone, but even in its place, the flesh underneath 
SPEAKER4 1:12:18
is blackened and cracked. 
SPEAKER1 1:12:20
There's not that much oxygen left in this fucking cave. 
SPEAKER5 1:12:22
At this point. I was gonna say, Amici's been slowly getting stupider with their jokes 
SPEAKER1 1:12:28
as if there was less oxygen left. 
SPEAKER5 1:12:30
At least I can go more than one round. Unlike you. Jesus, the horde's starting. Horde's gonna do the same thing horde's been doing. Is it gonna fire? 
SPEAKER1 1:12:44
Fire an axe. 
SPEAKER5 1:12:46
Hey! He's gonna hit his dog. 
SPEAKER6 1:12:48
There we go. 
SPEAKER4 1:12:50
He's like, ugh. Shit. 
SPEAKER3 1:12:54
Tired boss. 
SPEAKER4 1:12:56
He's gonna throw another one. 
SPEAKER1 1:12:58
That'll be another six damage. 
SPEAKER5 1:13:02
This creature, as it takes an axe, 
SPEAKER1 1:13:04
that kind of chops off 
SPEAKER5 1:13:06
the upper tip of where its 
SPEAKER4 1:13:08
head would be. 
SPEAKER5 1:13:10
Now it's looking kind of volcano-esque, but the flames in the fire come from the feet. The black anchor coming out of the midsection of the top 
SPEAKER1 1:13:18
and then just the top of its craggled surface, just packed on. He's turned this into 
SPEAKER5 1:13:26
a science fair project. It is its turn. It is going to say, fuck this shit. Um, except it really can't. It's gonna try and 
SPEAKER4 1:13:38
back up. 
SPEAKER1 1:13:40
Oh? 
SPEAKER5 1:13:42
It can move? 
SPEAKER1 1:13:44
I provoke an opportunity attack. 
SPEAKER5 1:13:46
Thank you. 
SPEAKER1 1:13:48
Wait, can I do one too? And it is going to try and excrete Tango and end it. It's gonna go for Michi. 
SPEAKER5 1:13:54
It's gonna go for Michi. 
SPEAKER1 1:13:56
I'm gonna go at it. Fuck that. Uncharge on this bitch. 
SPEAKER5 1:14:00
Okay, you get an attack of opportunity. I also, 22 does also hit you. We'll let your attack of opportunity go first. 
SPEAKER1 1:14:06
Do I also get this attack of opportunity since I'm like right there? You do, actually. Michi's gonna slap her sword 
SPEAKER5 1:14:14
and look over to Jez's leg trying to fist bump. Ready? 
SPEAKER4 1:14:18
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 1:14:20
I'm gonna go for the sword. 
SPEAKER2 1:14:22
Okay, well, here we go. Ring-a-ding-a-ding on my dick on that thing. 
SPEAKER1 1:14:28
What the fuck? I told the bell to finish that bitch. Would you like to describe how you finished this creature? Michi's just gonna stare blankly like, the fuck is going on? 
SPEAKER5 1:14:42
Just tapping her sword like she doesn't know what's going on at this point. 
SPEAKER1 1:14:48
I think between 
SPEAKER5 1:14:50
being choked out by a fucking 
SPEAKER1 1:14:52
rope or hand 
SPEAKER4 1:14:54
for some reason just 
SPEAKER1 1:14:56
all the fire text in Jez's explains the oxygen just fucking went there. I would like to leave. 
SPEAKER5 1:15:04
The snap at the hollow parts of your sword and the sound of a bell rings out once more as it does from every new hole and Orophys' creature hat just 
SPEAKER4 1:15:14
shrivels and then 
SPEAKER5 1:15:16
bursts out this 
SPEAKER1 1:15:18
gout of flesh 
SPEAKER5 1:15:20
and of black anger. 
SPEAKER1 1:15:22
It then crumbles and it swings in a hole in a like its own small lump of bruise. 
SPEAKER3 1:15:30
Uh huh. 
SPEAKER1 1:15:32
Well. 
SPEAKER5 1:15:34
Seems he couldn't hold that. 
SPEAKER1 1:15:36
Yeah. Ugh. 
SPEAKER4 1:15:40
I'm gonna take a second 
SPEAKER1 1:15:42
and catch my breath. 
SPEAKER5 1:15:44
Uh, with that actually, it is Nsanghung's turn. Nsanghung, could you make a perception check for me? Ooh, okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:15:52
Yeah, I hope you didn't think you guys were out of it now. Nah, not at all. 
SPEAKER6 1:15:56
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:15:58
Oh, wait. What's a- oh, I didn't mean to- I think I actually 
SPEAKER2 1:16:04
re-ruled. I got a- 
SPEAKER5 1:16:06
Where did I- I don't fucking know. 
SPEAKER1 1:16:08
Anyways. 
SPEAKER3 1:16:14
Nsanghung, as you 
SPEAKER4 1:16:16
hear twelve, 
SPEAKER3 1:16:18
Uh, yeah. you hear a sound. 
SPEAKER4 1:16:22
Further deep in the cave off to your left. Outside of this corner where you're fighting through the deep, you can hear a patterning of multiple 
SPEAKER1 1:16:32
things. Claws. 
SPEAKER4 1:16:34
Claws you don't know. You can hear some things walking. 
SPEAKER1 1:16:40
You've spent some time in the forest, haven't you? 
SPEAKER4 1:16:42
Yeah. Your home. You know the sound of 
SPEAKER3 1:16:46
cat and beast. 
SPEAKER1 1:16:48
It's an awful lot of that. 
SPEAKER4 1:16:50
Uh oh. 
SPEAKER1 1:16:52
And is it- 
SPEAKER2 1:16:54
I'm guessing it's off to kind of like- 
SPEAKER4 1:16:56
I'm trying to ping you. It's off over here. 
SPEAKER5 1:17:00
Okay. How far that cave goes down, 
SPEAKER4 1:17:04
I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 1:17:06
As you can see, it goes another- 
SPEAKER4 1:17:08
Uh, where you are, eh, about forty feet, 
SPEAKER1 1:17:12
forty-five feet to the inner wall. You can see the passage that curves up from there. 
SPEAKER3 1:17:20
Okay. Is something 
SPEAKER5 1:17:22
going to, um, probably just in the voice 
SPEAKER2 1:17:26
of like a 
SPEAKER5 1:17:28
random man. Just like something you would kind of overhear like- how do I- the distance? 
SPEAKER2 1:17:34
Uh, say, over here! And point towards that area. 
SPEAKER1 1:17:38
Um, as- I guess 
SPEAKER5 1:17:42
probably as bonus action to do that? Uh... That's just bonus action? 
SPEAKER1 1:17:52
Yeah, that's just bonus action. Persistent to point it out. Okay. Okay, he's gonna try to alert the others. Okay. Cool. From here we'll go into a looser initial. The round is at the top. It's round fifteen. 
SPEAKER2 1:18:20
Can I- 
SPEAKER5 1:18:22
Can I creep down that hallway? 
SPEAKER2 1:18:24
Can I creep down that hallway? 
SPEAKER3 1:18:26
Sure. Sure. Cool. Why can't I move? Why can't I move? Just like being very careful 
SPEAKER6 1:18:38
and trying to listen for what I can hear. 
SPEAKER2 1:18:40
And trying to listen for what I can hear. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:42
Start to move down the hallway. Start to move down the hallway. 
SPEAKER1 1:18:46
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:18:48
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:18:50
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:52
Alright. 
SPEAKER5 1:18:54
So you're gonna try and move down the hallway. 
SPEAKER1 1:18:56
Um, what you see- 
SPEAKER4 1:18:58
Go ahead, make a uh... 
SPEAKER3 1:19:02
26! 
SPEAKER4 1:19:04
Make a s- Make an... 
SPEAKER1 1:19:08
Go ahead and make another stealth check. 
SPEAKER4 1:19:10
Go ahead and make another stealth check. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:12
26. 
SPEAKER1 1:19:14
Okay, cool. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:16
Anything that wants to see me has disadvantage, 
SPEAKER5 1:19:18
also, by the way. 
SPEAKER1 1:19:20
Very cool. Okay, so you sneak here, Okay, so you sneak here, Okay, so you sneak here, 
SPEAKER4 1:19:28
Okay, so you sneak here, 
SPEAKER5 1:19:30
what you can see around the corner is you can see a pair of legs 
SPEAKER1 1:19:32
that's at the beginning of one of those small 
SPEAKER5 1:19:34
brain creakers that you had fought earlier on brain creakers that you had fought earlier on 
SPEAKER1 1:19:38
It seems to be sitting there, 
SPEAKER4 1:19:40
and it looks like it's focusing on and it looks like it's focusing on 
SPEAKER1 1:19:44
Junun and Insana. Or at least isn't aware in that direction. 
SPEAKER5 1:19:48
It's aware of where you guys are, 
SPEAKER1 1:19:50
is what you can tell. 
SPEAKER4 1:19:52
What does everyone else do in this one? 
SPEAKER6 1:19:54
Uh... Can everybody else see anything? Can everybody else see anything? 
SPEAKER5 1:20:00
Isan is gonna just start moving. Isan is gonna just start moving. 
SPEAKER6 1:20:04
You guys actually... 
SPEAKER5 1:20:06
Sorry, go ahead. 
SPEAKER2 1:20:08
I was just saying Isan, I was just gonna slowly back it away. 
SPEAKER5 1:20:10
I was just saying Isan, I was just gonna slowly back it away. You know, 
SPEAKER6 1:20:14
probably before we get the hell out of here, I should do this to you guys. We're not in combat right now, at least, right? 
SPEAKER1 1:20:20
We're not in combat right now, at least, right? We're not in combat right now, at least, right? 
SPEAKER5 1:20:24
You are in loose initiative. 
SPEAKER4 1:20:26
You are in loose initiative. 
SPEAKER6 1:20:28
Can I use an ability in loose initiative? 
SPEAKER1 1:20:30
Can I use an ability in loose initiative? 
SPEAKER2 1:20:32
Yes, what are you using? 
SPEAKER1 1:20:34
I'm giving everybody my eyesight distance. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:20:38
I would make it so... 
SPEAKER1 1:20:40
I would make it so that everyone can see, 
SPEAKER5 1:20:42
I would make it so that everyone can see, 
SPEAKER1 1:20:44
in the meantime. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:46
I'm just gonna say a bell chimes 
SPEAKER6 1:20:48
I'm just gonna say a bell chimes that the twilight kind of fades, yet still persists. Your vision improves. 
SPEAKER4 1:20:56
Everybody has 
SPEAKER1 1:20:58
the sight that Michi has. Yippee! 
SPEAKER6 1:21:02
Once I figure out how to guarantee it to you all. 
SPEAKER4 1:21:04
I'm already modifying your face. 
SPEAKER6 1:21:06
I'm already modifying your face. The spell should be able to just hand it to him, but alright. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:12
Your veil. 
SPEAKER6 1:21:14
The veil has been lifted. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:16
The veil has been lifted. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:20
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:22
Okay. Okay. Okay. Horace has moved. 
SPEAKER4 1:21:30
Michi has done her thing. 
SPEAKER5 1:21:32
Horace is going to say, 
SPEAKER4 1:21:34
Maybe we should get out of here. I can't get into another fight. 
SPEAKER6 1:21:42
You're right. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:44
It's a good option. It's a good option. 
SPEAKER6 1:21:48
What? 
SPEAKER2 1:21:50
Is there anything we can do to save this thing? Maybe if I check a body nearby? 
SPEAKER5 1:21:54
Maybe if I check a body nearby? 
SPEAKER3 1:21:56
Real quick. 
SPEAKER6 1:21:58
I'm just gonna pick the thing up and fucking carry it with me. 
SPEAKER5 1:22:02
The Roper itself? 
SPEAKER6 1:22:04
Yep. That's an easy feat for Michi. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:08
That's an easy feat for Michi. 
SPEAKER4 1:22:10
With that, 
SPEAKER5 1:22:12
Gord is going to begin moving back towards the 
SPEAKER4 1:22:14
I have to measure my position 
SPEAKER1 1:22:16
in line. 
SPEAKER5 1:22:18
Gord is going to be moving... Back towards the exit 
SPEAKER1 1:22:22
and begin to climb. 
SPEAKER4 1:22:24
And Songhong, you are up next. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:26
What are you doing this time? 
SPEAKER2 1:22:28
He's right with them. 
SPEAKER5 1:22:30
He is getting the fuck out of here. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:32
Okay. Mm-mm. 
SPEAKER6 1:22:36
I think we still have time. 
SPEAKER2 1:22:38
Let's go. And Michi is going to follow up. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:42
Forze, you ready? 
SPEAKER6 1:22:46
I'll take that as a yes. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:48
I'll take that as a yes. 
SPEAKER6 1:22:50
And Michi is going to just draw over. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:52
I'll take that as a yes. 
SPEAKER6 1:22:58
Wait. A moment. 
SPEAKER3 1:23:00
Bird? 
SPEAKER1 1:23:02
Bird? 
SPEAKER5 1:23:04
He's like, kind of, 
SPEAKER6 1:23:06
What's our timer right now? 
SPEAKER4 1:23:08
This is round 15. Actually, Gizzard, 
SPEAKER2 1:23:12
Fuck me. 
SPEAKER1 1:23:14
Gizzard will agree to reluctantly resign. 
SPEAKER2 1:23:18
Gizzard will agree to reluctantly resign. 
SPEAKER6 1:23:20
Gizzard will agree to reluctantly resign. 
SPEAKER1 1:23:22
Someone grab him. 
SPEAKER6 1:23:24
Grab the dogs if you can. Grab the dogs if you can. 
SPEAKER1 1:23:28
Gizzard will grab a dog? 
SPEAKER6 1:23:30
Gizzard will grab a dog? I guess? Here, just put it in the bag. There's no live one, right? 
SPEAKER5 1:23:38
Oh no, neither of them are live. One of them has their entire midsection paint now. The other one is missing the front end of it. 
SPEAKER1 1:23:44
Oh shit. 
SPEAKER5 1:23:46
So we got two halves. 
SPEAKER6 1:23:48
We got two corresponding halves of a dog. 
SPEAKER2 1:23:50
We got two corresponding halves of a dog. 
SPEAKER3 1:23:52
Michi is, uh, 
SPEAKER6 1:23:54
gonna put the dogs in the bag, and as she does, she's gonna jostle the fucking thing to see if she can shake anything out of this bastard. 
SPEAKER3 1:24:00
As you do, 
SPEAKER5 1:24:02
a small bit of undissected, or undigested 
SPEAKER4 1:24:06
viscera spills out. 
SPEAKER5 1:24:08
You do not know exactly what item I gave you. There's my liver. 
SPEAKER1 1:24:12
Anyways. Uh, does it look like it? 
SPEAKER6 1:24:16
It looks like there's at least one tattered couch in there. 
SPEAKER5 1:24:18
It looks like there's at least one tattered couch in there. 
SPEAKER1 1:24:20
Half digested. But there's a compartment in there. 
SPEAKER4 1:24:24
I'mma grab it. 
SPEAKER1 1:24:26
I'll have you do an investigation or inspection later, cause that was Jizzik's turn. 
SPEAKER4 1:24:32
Are you following the rest of the party out? 
SPEAKER1 1:24:34
It looks like. Can you hear us, Forrest? 
SPEAKER4 1:24:40
Can you hear us, Forrest? 
SPEAKER1 1:24:42
Uh, internet. 
SPEAKER2 1:24:44
I will play for Forrest. 
SPEAKER1 1:24:46
I heard, I heard, Forrest? Yes, it looks like your party at this point is cutting and running. 
SPEAKER5 1:24:52
Are you going to follow? 
SPEAKER2 1:24:54
Yeah, I don't know why it's cutting out. 
SPEAKER1 1:24:56
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER4 1:24:58
Bail. 
SPEAKER1 1:25:00
Forrest? 
SPEAKER5 1:25:02
It is your turn right now. 
SPEAKER2 1:25:06
Ah. Okay. I'll follow everybody else. If we're going. 
SPEAKER5 1:25:12
Somewhere. 
SPEAKER4 1:25:14
Uh, they are trying to go back out at the meeting. 
SPEAKER2 1:25:16
Great idea! Let's go! 
SPEAKER3 1:25:18
Let's retreat. 
SPEAKER1 1:25:20
You know, a tactical withdrawal. 
SPEAKER5 1:25:24
I follow along. 
SPEAKER6 1:25:26
With haste, out. 
SPEAKER2 1:25:28
Withdrawing for the week. 
SPEAKER6 1:25:30
Yay. 
SPEAKER5 1:25:32
Only quizzies fall out. 
SPEAKER4 1:25:34
Okay, that's the end of Forrest's turn. Forrest, I assume you're going to move your logistics to get out? 
SPEAKER3 1:25:38
Uh, yeah. 
SPEAKER2 1:25:40
I'll just follow behind everybody else. So that I know where we're going. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:25:46
Michi, it is your next turn. 
SPEAKER2 1:25:48
Okay, so these dogs are in my fucking bag. 
SPEAKER6 1:25:50
I'm, uh, I picked up the scroll. And I'm dashing out of here. The bodies are with me. 
SPEAKER3 1:25:56
You fucking know it. 
SPEAKER2 1:26:00
Gotta have food for the road, you know. 
SPEAKER6 1:26:02
We can't go out there without food. 
SPEAKER1 1:26:04
Jesus fucking Christ. 
SPEAKER6 1:26:06
Alright, put the fucking rubber in my bags. 
SPEAKER3 1:26:08
And the dogs. 
SPEAKER2 1:26:10
Put the dogs in the bag! 
SPEAKER4 1:26:12
I'm dashing to put the two dog corpses and your roper corpse into the bag and then move to me. 
SPEAKER6 1:26:20
I'm using dash to get the fuck out of here since we're still on initiative. 
SPEAKER4 1:26:22
I'm using dash as a bonus action. 
SPEAKER6 1:26:24
I'm using it as a bonus action. 
SPEAKER4 1:26:26
Can you use it as a bonus action? 
SPEAKER6 1:26:28
You said a fighter could, yeah? 
SPEAKER4 1:26:30
No, that's a roger baby. 
SPEAKER6 1:26:32
What the fuck, Devon? 
SPEAKER4 1:26:34
Can I use it as a bonus action? You're also using a bonus action to put the things into the bag. 
SPEAKER6 1:26:40
Oh, then I'm just fucking walking out of here then. Just walking out. Mosey-ing. 
SPEAKER3 1:26:46
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:26:48
I just wanna put it out there that Devon said that my stuff fell on the floor. 
SPEAKER6 1:26:52
Uh, Michi, pick that up. 
SPEAKER1 1:26:54
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:26:56
Okay, so Michi's using her action. She picks everything up and then is strutting on it. 
SPEAKER4 1:27:02
Damn right. 
SPEAKER5 1:27:04
Alright, board's doing the same. 
SPEAKER4 1:27:06
Board at this point now leads to the top of, uh, now leads to the top of the, basically, passage. 
SPEAKER1 1:27:16
I'm healing the fucking roper. 
SPEAKER6 1:27:18
He keeps asking me to heal the roper because no one else can be healed. 
SPEAKER5 1:27:22
And Songhung, you're up next. You're also following up and out of the cavern? 
SPEAKER2 1:27:26
Yep, he's just, he's focused on just getting out of here. 
SPEAKER5 1:27:28
Okay. Juzer, are you doing anything stupid? 
SPEAKER1 1:27:32
No, just following. 
SPEAKER6 1:27:34
Alright. 
SPEAKER2 1:27:36
Are you also gonna follow the party out of the, of the ta- of the, of the, the, of the cave? 
SPEAKER4 1:27:42
Okay. At the beginning of the next round, after everyone has left, you are all at the top of the cavern where you had just discovered and have attempted to save you. 
SPEAKER3 1:27:58
You now lie as half a corpse in Songhung's back. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:28:06
What do you guys do to an item? I'm gonna use the road to the back. 
SPEAKER6 1:28:10
Are we back on the other level? Yes, you're back on the other level. 
SPEAKER5 1:28:14
Secret passage? 
SPEAKER1 1:28:16
Secret tunnel, yes. 
SPEAKER2 1:28:18
Secret tunnel. 
SPEAKER1 1:28:20
I will move, I will move your character to the next level. 
SPEAKER6 1:28:22
Uh, can you put down a new, a new Michi, please? Because the token that's out there right now is old. Is Alf there? 
SPEAKER2 1:28:28
Are they, are they there? 
SPEAKER3 1:28:30
Uh, we'll get to that. 
SPEAKER5 1:28:32
We'll get to that in a moment. 
SPEAKER2 1:28:34
Glory! I'm eager! I'm also dead, but I'm eager! I'm an eager ghost! 
SPEAKER6 1:28:42
Michi's gonna hastily look through this fucking shit real quick to see if I find any. 
SPEAKER4 1:28:46
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Move some tokens around. 
SPEAKER3 1:28:52
Come on, god. 
SPEAKER4 1:28:54
You know you have to be faster than this. 
SPEAKER6 1:28:56
Lazy shit. 
SPEAKER3 1:28:58
Fuck you. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:29:06
Dual folk here. Let's try to do somersault or something... 
SPEAKER4 1:29:12
Yeah, we gotta take a very slow, like, 14 minute jump. Tear me up first! 
SPEAKER2 1:29:16
Yeah! 
SPEAKER3 1:29:18
Yup. 
SPEAKER6 1:29:20
Let's try to move wa- Oh!!! 
SPEAKER3 1:29:24
No. Welcome to another organisation. 
SPEAKER4 1:29:28
I just kinda found and discovered this move. Yes. I swear it's one of the funniest processes in your life. 
SPEAKER6 1:29:34
I was trying to help you, but I don't know which ones you want me to do. 
SPEAKER5 1:29:36
No, you're good. You're good. We're good. 
SPEAKER3 1:29:38
We're good. Alright. I'm dead. 
SPEAKER6 1:29:42
Well, most of you are dead. 
SPEAKER4 1:29:44
Some of you are. 
SPEAKER6 1:29:48
Not gonna lie, I'm a little surprised 
SPEAKER2 1:29:50
that Songun hasn't died by this point in the campaign. I know. I am too. 
SPEAKER3 1:29:54
But, 
SPEAKER5 1:29:56
it helps when, uh, go ahead. 
SPEAKER4 1:29:58
You investigate the spell and the spell scroll. There are two scrolls in the spell scroll. One of them is a scroll of banishment. The other is a scroll of divinification. 
SPEAKER3 1:30:08
Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER6 1:30:10
Must have gotten more than just us before. 
SPEAKER3 1:30:14
Well, 
SPEAKER2 1:30:16
give me the bird, or give me the bird, bird, fucking bird, give me the damn body. Songun, uh, 
SPEAKER5 1:30:22
hearing Meechie's, like, uh, 
SPEAKER6 1:30:24
um, like, flubbering 
SPEAKER2 1:30:26
also kind of flubs around himself, 
SPEAKER6 1:30:28
um, haphazardly 
SPEAKER3 1:30:30
these 
SPEAKER5 1:30:32
Jesus Christ, sorry, that fucking fart-ripping sound is so loud, um, 
SPEAKER2 1:30:36
he's gonna haphazardly kind of, like, joggle the bag out, uh, and, like, 
SPEAKER6 1:30:42
open it and 
SPEAKER2 1:30:44
summon forth the corpse 
SPEAKER5 1:30:46
of Jinud, which just kind of falls 
SPEAKER3 1:30:48
to the ground, like, 
SPEAKER1 1:30:50
like a, like a splat. 
SPEAKER4 1:30:52
Wait, quick thought. 
SPEAKER5 1:30:54
Oh my god. 
SPEAKER4 1:30:56
Uh-huh. ... ... ... ... 
SPEAKER3 1:31:06
... 
SPEAKER6 1:31:08
I'm gonna reach into my bag, grab the fucking roper and just call forth it, shoving my hand into its throat to find whatever's missing of Jinud 
SPEAKER3 1:31:16
and pulling it out. 
SPEAKER4 1:31:18
... ... 
SPEAKER3 1:31:22
Slap goes under. 
SPEAKER4 1:31:24
... 
SPEAKER6 1:31:26
... 
SPEAKER3 1:31:28
You know what? 
SPEAKER5 1:31:30
How about this? Just empties the fuck. 
SPEAKER2 1:31:32
keyrope her on top of Juno's body. Michi's gonna snatch the scroll. Round two. Fucking hasty. 
SPEAKER5 1:31:42
Everything wasted. Let's go. 
SPEAKER6 1:31:46
Michi's gonna fucking just 
SPEAKER3 1:31:48
stare at this cat. 
SPEAKER5 1:31:51
Better be fucking worth it. I swear. Lessons 
SPEAKER2 1:31:55
learned for everybody. 
SPEAKER6 1:31:57
And she's just gonna finish off the scroll. The fresh, revivified, 
SPEAKER5 1:32:02
the rarity it is. Juno. 
SPEAKER4 1:32:07
You weren't just approaching the pearly gates. I believe you. 
SPEAKER5 1:32:12
You were there. 
SPEAKER4 1:32:15
You were crossing the river of snakes. You know this. You were gone. 
SPEAKER5 1:32:21
Describe 
SPEAKER4 1:32:22
what it feels like now to be brought back. 
SPEAKER5 1:32:25
I'll describe 
SPEAKER4 1:32:26
the physical part. Describe what goes through Juno's mind as your consciousness is brought back from an inky, pale void of serenity and thrust back into the world. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:43
You know, like, when you ate a lot of greasy food 
SPEAKER6 1:32:46
and then you went 
SPEAKER2 1:32:48
on a rollercoaster? 
SPEAKER3 1:32:50
That's exactly how it feels.

SPEAKER6 1:33:27
no no 
SPEAKER5 1:33:27
no but 
SPEAKER4 1:33:28
if 
SPEAKER1 1:33:28
if needing 
SPEAKER4 1:33:29
And I woke this up. 
SPEAKER2 1:33:34
I thought I was more than 10 turns. 
SPEAKER5 1:33:37
Nope. You were at round 17. 
SPEAKER4 1:33:39
One more round and it would have been 10 turns. 
SPEAKER2 1:33:44
You said round 17. You ended on round 7. You went down on round 8. 
SPEAKER4 1:33:50
That's when your final death saving throw was cropped. 
SPEAKER6 1:33:53
All 8. 
SPEAKER4 1:33:54
We were on round 17. The end of round 17. When Michi cast Vivify. 
SPEAKER5 1:34:01
You had one more round. 
SPEAKER4 1:34:02
Six more seconds. Before that scroll would have failed. 
SPEAKER2 1:34:07
Oh. 
SPEAKER5 1:34:08
I was counting. 
SPEAKER4 1:34:10
That's why I said you guys were in loose initially. But not out of initiative. 
SPEAKER6 1:34:14
I see now. 
SPEAKER3 1:34:15
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:34:16
Notably. Vivify will bring your creature back to life. 
SPEAKER4 1:34:21
With one hit point. It will not restore any of the missing body parts. 
SPEAKER3 1:34:27
Even when you're dead. 
SPEAKER6 1:34:28
With all the chunky mish that I put all over her. 
SPEAKER2 1:34:31
Yes. 
SPEAKER4 1:34:32
Those body parts are destroyed. 
SPEAKER6 1:34:34
Wait. 
SPEAKER2 1:34:36
How the fuck am I still alive? 
SPEAKER5 1:34:39
That's what I'm getting to. The excruciating pain of going back 
SPEAKER4 1:34:42
is the flesh on your torso regrowing before it grows over both the nub that is your arm and the empty gaping space that was where your right or left leg was. One of them is a vacuous space. The other, a mangled, kind of like, less than half a hand size. 
SPEAKER6 1:35:07
No. 
SPEAKER5 1:35:10
Well, look at you. 
SPEAKER2 1:35:11
Distinguished. 
SPEAKER6 1:35:12
Distinguished. 
SPEAKER2 1:35:15
Describe that one more time. With less 
SPEAKER3 1:35:19
extra details 
SPEAKER2 1:35:21
of what I look like, please. 
SPEAKER5 1:35:23
You are missing, 
SPEAKER4 1:35:25
I believe it is your 
SPEAKER3 1:35:26
right leg. 
SPEAKER6 1:35:28
Right. 
SPEAKER4 1:35:29
And your left arm. 
SPEAKER3 1:35:32
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:35:32
Your right leg is gone at the hip where a vacuous space is. Your left arm is a small nub at the shoulder. 
SPEAKER2 1:35:44
So I am no longer a monk. 
SPEAKER5 1:35:47
I mean, you'd have to probably relearn how to monk. 
SPEAKER1 1:35:51
There is no more monkeying for me. 
SPEAKER3 1:35:57
But, 
SPEAKER4 1:35:58
you can add this to your Rolodex of characters that you can play with this in the works. 
SPEAKER2 1:36:03
I'm going to kill him. I'm going to fucking kill him. Janoon is saying this out loud. I'm going to fucking kill him. 
SPEAKER6 1:36:18
Gonna grab you by the neck. 
SPEAKER2 1:36:19
Up you go. No time at all. Janoon just starts 
SPEAKER3 1:36:27
saying, 
SPEAKER6 1:36:28
shaking, coughing as he can't even stand 
SPEAKER5 1:36:32
and is just 
SPEAKER6 1:36:33
struggling to. 
SPEAKER2 1:36:37
Can I use an action? 
SPEAKER4 1:36:39
Sure, because at this point I will say we are out of initiative. 
SPEAKER6 1:36:43
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:36:43
I'm going to 
SPEAKER6 1:36:45
cast heal once you put the token back down for Janoon. 
SPEAKER4 1:36:49
I should probably do that. 
SPEAKER5 1:36:52
And who are you going to kill? 
SPEAKER6 1:36:54
Janoon. 
SPEAKER2 1:36:58
I can't point at anyone who can even stand at this moment. 
SPEAKER6 1:37:03
So he's just going to look over at the gnome and the dragon. 
SPEAKER3 1:37:11
Oh. 
SPEAKER6 1:37:13
Well, I can wait until we're after here. 
SPEAKER3 1:37:16
It would be a good place to bury your body, but we must sleep. No. Soon. 
SPEAKER6 1:37:22
Michi is going to give her the whole fucking lift and carry her. Just a small little fucking. You know what? No, fuck that. 
SPEAKER2 1:37:31
I'm not carrying you. 
SPEAKER3 1:37:32
You can walk with me. 
SPEAKER6 1:37:33
Just wobble. I've seen worse. As Michi places a hand on their shoulder to heal them up. 
SPEAKER5 1:37:50
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:37:51
What is everyone else doing? 
SPEAKER2 1:37:54
I'm going to follow along. After Michi and Janoon. And help us again. 
SPEAKER6 1:37:59
Isahn has to get the fuck out of here, but with them. 
SPEAKER3 1:38:04
Not like going past them. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:06
I'm not sure who's following Janoon. 
SPEAKER2 1:38:09
Janoon cannot walk. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:11
Michi's running forward. 
SPEAKER2 1:38:12
Janoon has never experienced this before. Janoon cannot even stand. 
SPEAKER3 1:38:18
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:19
Then roll an order. 
SPEAKER2 1:38:21
Michi's in front. 
SPEAKER3 1:38:22
Follow as you hold the rear. 
SPEAKER2 1:38:25
By strength, mitad. 
SPEAKER3 1:38:28
Sweet rat-pat. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:29
ull. 
SPEAKER1 1:38:30
Help the gook. 
SPEAKER3 1:38:31
Cat, don't eat the bird. 
SPEAKER2 1:38:32
Dee, da, da! A snowman? My鸣. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:35
Minuten- Just formation was gone. 
SPEAKER3 1:38:36
I'm wage labor, Èhrertиû. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:37
Each of you are 
SPEAKER3 1:38:40
Without a cleaning to up. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:43
Take care, 그건. When 
SPEAKER3 1:38:46
Let's get my house down. 
SPEAKER1 1:38:49
Yeah, that. 
SPEAKER3 1:38:51
76. 
SPEAKER2 1:38:53
And just because you've healed me... Internally doesn't mean I can fucking stand you, idiot. You do not see this missing limb. These missing limbs! 
SPEAKER6 1:39:15
Ichi's gonna start casting wounds and then poke the fucking limb. 
SPEAKER2 1:39:19
Shut up your mouth, you whiner. 
SPEAKER6 1:39:21
It's been worse. 
SPEAKER3 1:39:22
The limbs don't grow back, by the way. 
SPEAKER2 1:39:25
How about we hop on your fucking leg and see you walk your ass down this cave? 
SPEAKER6 1:39:36
Ichi's gonna give a deathly fucking stare. You wouldn't even understand. 
SPEAKER3 1:39:41
Anyways, I'm not healing the leg, I'm healing her just generally. 
SPEAKER6 1:39:47
Let's just be an addict. 
SPEAKER3 1:39:48
Can I cast Mending on the leg? 
SPEAKER1 1:39:52
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 1:39:52
On the pile of mush? 
SPEAKER4 1:39:54
You can certainly try. 
SPEAKER3 1:39:56
Alright. Does that feel better? I try Mending the mush. 
SPEAKER4 1:40:02
You spend the cantrip that he's Mending out into the mush and nothing happens. 
SPEAKER3 1:40:10
Damn. Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:40:14
Well, I would love to be playing with our visceral all day. I would love the hell to get out of here. So do we go back the way we came, or should we try to cut through the... Or should we try to cut through the... 
SPEAKER6 1:40:22
And maybe find a path? 
SPEAKER3 1:40:24
And maybe find a path. I think we should probably avoid getting lost and go the way we came. 
SPEAKER2 1:40:28
I think we should probably avoid getting lost and go the way we came. 
SPEAKER3 1:40:32
Very well. Any objections? Any objections? Nah. 
SPEAKER6 1:40:40
Alright, we're heading out. 
SPEAKER3 1:40:42
And we travel the way. 
SPEAKER4 1:40:44
Okay. Are you heading all the way back up to the beginning of the cave and then out, or are you trying to just find a safe spot? And we travel the way. 
SPEAKER3 1:40:52
Alright, we're heading out. And we travel the way. Okay. Are you heading all the way back up to the beginning of the cave and then out, or are you trying to just find a safe spot? Safe space, I say. 
SPEAKER6 1:41:00
Oh. Are you saying that in character? I'm asking the players. Yeah, okay. I think we should go to a safe place. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:10
And rest. Or no. We need to... 
SPEAKER6 1:41:16
Someone else has something to do. Do you mean stay... Look for a safe place inside? Do you mean stay inside this cave and stay inside it, or leave and try and find somewhere outside? Januna clearly needs help. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:28
Yep. 
SPEAKER2 1:41:30
Ward's not too far from behind there. So maybe a quick rest as we make our way out so we're all topped up. 
SPEAKER6 1:41:34
So maybe a quick rest as we make our way out so we're all topped up. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:36
Yes? 
SPEAKER6 1:41:38
I'm gonna call to the Floop. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:40
Floop! 
SPEAKER6 1:41:42
That's just right across the way from me. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:44
Gesturing. 
SPEAKER5 1:41:46
Carefully. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:48
A familiar pancake shape. 
SPEAKER4 1:41:50
Approaches you, Januna. And approaches me, Januna. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:54
And Alfie is there. 
SPEAKER4 1:41:56
Hovering in the space, it looks at you, concerned. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:58
Hovering in the space, it looks at you, concerned. We need a place to rest. 
SPEAKER6 1:42:04
And to hide for a bit. So we can get out of here safely. 
SPEAKER3 1:42:08
Telepathically, it says. 
SPEAKER4 1:42:10
Follow and find rest. 
SPEAKER3 1:42:14
Everybody good? Whoop. Shall we go? 
SPEAKER2 1:42:20
Follow again? 
SPEAKER4 1:42:22
Seems they haven't destroyed us once. 
SPEAKER6 1:42:24
Maybe a good option to take their chance. 
SPEAKER3 1:42:26
Maybe a good option to take their chance. 
SPEAKER6 1:42:28
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 1:42:30
Yeah, let's just do that. 
SPEAKER3 1:42:32
Michi's gonna fucking follow, dude. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:42:36
Januna and Isak, please describe how you're making things work. 
SPEAKER5 1:42:38
Januna and Isak, please describe how you're making things work. 
SPEAKER3 1:42:40
As you try to move through space. So I think Isak is like 4'11", 4'9". 
SPEAKER6 1:42:44
So I think Isak is like 4'11", 4'9". 
SPEAKER2 1:42:46
Like around there. 
SPEAKER6 1:42:48
How tall is Januna? How tall is Januna? 
SPEAKER3 1:42:50
5'11". 
SPEAKER2 1:42:52
Oh, damn. Isakhan will awkwardly shuffleują 
SPEAKER5 1:42:58
Isakhan will awkwardly shuffle and try to grab Januna's arm 
SPEAKER3 1:43:02
and try to grab Januna's arm 
SPEAKER2 1:43:04
and throw it over him. and throw it over him. Kind of lands like, You know when like someone's way taller than you and they kind of put like, their elbow arm like rests on your head kind of? 
SPEAKER6 1:43:16
their elbow arm like rests on your head kind of? 
SPEAKER3 1:43:18
Nope. 
SPEAKER2 1:43:20
well, you're excessively tall. Everyone else here is, like, excessively tall. 
SPEAKER6 1:43:25
But, you know, people who are average, like, 5'2", 5'1", 5'3", height, 
SPEAKER2 1:43:32
totally know what this is like. 
SPEAKER3 1:43:35
Right? 
SPEAKER2 1:43:36
Everyone with the average height is small. Shut up. No, like, when someone, like, kind of leans on you, but, like, puts their arm on top of your head, 
SPEAKER6 1:43:48
like, when they're trying to make a point of, like, you being short. 
SPEAKER2 1:43:53
You know what I mean? 
SPEAKER5 1:43:57
Yeah, I know what you mean. 
SPEAKER2 1:43:58
Okay, okay. They kind of end up doing that. I was trying to adjust his arm, and it kind of just ends up on top of his head. 
SPEAKER5 1:44:07
And he's like, okay, well. 
SPEAKER2 1:44:09
The noon just notices the bird struggling and gets annoyed. 
SPEAKER6 1:44:13
So he pulls out another, his last two masts. 
SPEAKER3 1:44:18
Gives out of his cloak. 
SPEAKER6 1:44:22
Now has one cloak. 
SPEAKER3 1:44:27
And he's going to sit on top of them. 
SPEAKER1 1:44:32
On the one of them. 
SPEAKER2 1:44:36
And have them guide him. 
SPEAKER3 1:44:41
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:44:42
Isagon's going to kind of huff. 
SPEAKER6 1:44:44
Be like, all right then. But just start walking. And kind of looking back a little to make sure that he's not, like, 
SPEAKER5 1:44:54
just falling all over the place. 
SPEAKER3 1:44:56
But, yeah. 
SPEAKER4 1:45:00
Okay. As your noon is being less curried by and more dragged by, two masts are suddenly manifesting. The rest of you follow suit. The flunk out. Down the cavern. 
SPEAKER5 1:45:18
Did you say curried? 
SPEAKER4 1:45:20
Yeah, curried as in carried. That is in fact a word you can use for that purpose. 
SPEAKER2 1:45:30
I thought you just pronounced it slightly funny. 
SPEAKER6 1:45:33
I'm going to defer it because I think you're struggling. 
SPEAKER4 1:45:35
Thanks. 
SPEAKER6 1:45:36
Thanks. 
SPEAKER4 1:45:40
You need to back down part of the way you came. And why is it now? 
SPEAKER5 1:45:48
I'll make it just, like, one fucking time. 
SPEAKER6 1:45:52
Because you have border walls here. 
SPEAKER4 1:45:57
Border walls, border lands. 
SPEAKER1 1:45:58
You know. 
SPEAKER5 1:45:59
It will lead you to this kind of alcove hidden, 
SPEAKER4 1:46:02
similar to where the last place that you guys stayed. Two. 
SPEAKER1 1:46:10
Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. 
SPEAKER3 1:46:14
Nine. Ten. 
SPEAKER1 1:46:16
Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. 
SPEAKER3 1:46:17
Ten. 
SPEAKER1 1:46:18
Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. 
SPEAKER4 1:46:20
I'm only imagining it being to the spread over to David for this, you know. Yuri. 
SPEAKER1 1:46:27
Hi, my name is Ricky. 
SPEAKER3 1:46:29
I'm prepping a video about you, and I look forward to playing in the 
SPEAKER6 1:46:32
 
SPEAKER3 1:46:37
All right, okay. All right, all right, I just want to go ahead. 
SPEAKER6 1:46:45
And you can hear that I have the map. 
SPEAKER4 1:46:47
Okay. Alright guys, Del taking a short or a long rest? 
SPEAKER3 1:46:53
I'm taking a short rest. Word. Uh, that was Fours, but Fours is gonna take a short rest. Uh oh. I think Isonhan is... 
SPEAKER4 1:47:12
Uh, why the fuck does Isonhan attack us? 
SPEAKER3 1:47:15
Word. Sorry. The Flogs. The Flogs. 
SPEAKER4 1:47:28
Okay, you guys are able to take a short rest. You can reroll your hit die if you'd like. Or, roll your hit die if you'd like. 
SPEAKER6 1:47:37
I get Fools, so... I do like. And I will. 
SPEAKER3 1:47:41
In a second. I think I can do that anytime. I need... I need Horde, Jizzard, J'Noon... 
SPEAKER6 1:48:10
Everybody except for me to roll a 1-2. Okay. I'll roll a d6, please. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:13
Okay. Oh wait, I did this earlier. Okay. Five. Okay. 
SPEAKER6 1:48:29
That'll be a 1. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:30
I guess. 
SPEAKER6 1:48:34
Jizzard's topped out. He doesn't need shit. Oh, is this a temp HP? Yeah, cause I turned it off and I didn't know how many rounds it would've went. So... 
SPEAKER3 1:48:42
This is the last one it's gonna do for taking a rest here. 
SPEAKER6 1:48:43
And then J'Noon gets 6. Can... Can I roll Equations? You can. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:46
I think you can. Pretty sorry, sir. 
SPEAKER6 1:48:48
How does a hit die heal? It depends on your class. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:50
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:51
It's something that's on my paper character sheet. 
SPEAKER6 1:48:52
Oh, I see. 
SPEAKER5 1:48:53
I see. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:54
I see. I see. I see. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:57
I see. I see. I see. 
SPEAKER6 1:49:00
I see. I see. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:02
I see. I see. I see. 
SPEAKER1 1:49:05
I see. 
SPEAKER4 1:49:06
I see. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:07
I see. 
SPEAKER6 1:49:08
I see. I see. I see. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:11
I see. I see. I see. 
SPEAKER5 1:49:14
I see. 
SPEAKER4 1:49:15
I see. I see. 
SPEAKER5 1:49:17
I see. 
SPEAKER4 1:49:18
I see. I see. I see. I see. ... 
SPEAKER3 1:49:23
Uh, there's a button. The, uh, fork and knife in your character sheet is a short rest. 
SPEAKER1 1:49:25
It'll detect how many hit guys you have. 
SPEAKER4 1:49:26
You can roll one at a time, and it will add to your HP. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:27
Oh, there's a fork and knife? Yes. Right next to the long rest button. 
SPEAKER1 1:49:30
Oh, there it is. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:31
And will this take into account my, uh, my object? 
SPEAKER1 1:49:36
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 1:49:37
It does take into account my object. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:39
Sigh. Can I use my cleric ability hit dice? What do you mean cleric ability hit dice? 
SPEAKER6 1:49:52
Because I have d8 and d10. 
SPEAKER4 1:49:54
Yeah, so your hit dice are determined by your class. So your d8s should be probably cleric, your d10s should be fighters. A fighter might also be d12. 
SPEAKER3 1:50:04
It shows me d8 and d10, so I'll just do that instead. Either way, it doesn't matter. I have 8 back or 10 back, so I'll take the higher two. I don't hear anything. 
SPEAKER2 1:50:32
It's not... 
SPEAKER4 1:50:33
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 1:50:34
So does it consume a hit die? 
SPEAKER4 1:50:36
Yes. You get your hit dice back on a long rest. 
SPEAKER3 1:50:39
It didn't consume a hit die, so... 
SPEAKER4 1:50:42
It should have. It should say you should have X amount remaining. 
SPEAKER3 1:50:45
It says I have 6 out of 6. I'll heal that up. Ready to rock and roll. 
SPEAKER5 1:50:52
Okay, you might be moving 0 to two different classes, but... 
SPEAKER3 1:50:54
I don't think I get... 
SPEAKER6 1:50:58
I had just rolled a d6, so I didn't do anything with the hit die on the thing. 
SPEAKER5 1:51:03
Let me... 
SPEAKER3 1:51:04
Let me... How do I... How do I use a hit die? 
SPEAKER4 1:51:08
To use a hit die, once you go into short rest, so here, I'll show you this. 
SPEAKER3 1:51:16
Oh, wait. It's almost like you went through that just two seconds ago. 
SPEAKER6 1:51:21
Oh! Sorry, I got it. I don't think I get any spell slots back. 
SPEAKER4 1:51:28
Do you get sorcerer points back? Uh... 
SPEAKER3 1:51:31
Oh, that's a good question, actually. I don't think I get spell slots, unfortunately. 
SPEAKER6 1:51:39
You get your dragon's breath back. 
SPEAKER3 1:51:41
That's after a long rest. 
SPEAKER6 1:51:43
It's a short rest on it. 
SPEAKER3 1:51:45
Really? Yep. 
SPEAKER6 1:51:48
I made sure that your class showed the right abilities for that, at least. 
SPEAKER4 1:51:52
Oh, alright. But if you get your sorcery points back, that's a sorcery point. The sorcery points dispels. 
SPEAKER3 1:51:58
Oh. 
SPEAKER6 1:52:00
Oh, that's right. There's like a whole table for like, how many points. This is like a one level spell, and how many is a two? If you look, I think it's at the front of magic, it tells you the table. 
SPEAKER3 1:52:14
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER6 1:52:18
Shit. 
SPEAKER3 1:52:19
Try it. How do I read? Oh, shit. 
SPEAKER6 1:52:23
It'll click to lock. 
SPEAKER3 1:52:24
Oh, it disappeared. Oh! Stop! There. Oh, yeah. It's been one spell slot. Again, the number of sorcery points is equal to the slot number. 
SPEAKER6 1:52:43
You can convert spells to sorcery points. 
SPEAKER3 1:52:46
Oh, there it is. 
SPEAKER6 1:52:48
Wait, you can roll multiple times in a short rest? 
SPEAKER3 1:52:50
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 1:52:51
You can roll as many hit dice as you have. 
SPEAKER3 1:52:54
Oh. I'm not gonna. Fuck that. 
SPEAKER4 1:52:57
So if you have six hit dice, so for example, I already rolled four. But for me, if I hit the, and I'm sure I missed, if I hit that short rest button, it'll ask, select dice to roll. And I can say, I will roll my dice, like that roll button, it will roll over and over again. 
SPEAKER1 1:53:16
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER6 1:53:17
I didn't know that. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:18
And then automatically, I have 10 hit points. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:19
And then I can say, if it's a new day, and if I have had any abilities or items that said, you gain this thing X amount of time per day, as opposed to on a long rest or on a short rest. Then it would try and recharge. But it hasn't been a day yet, so. Gotcha. 
SPEAKER5 1:53:33
All right, cool. 
SPEAKER3 1:53:34
So a short rest takes an hour. What are you guys doing during that? Processing trauma. 
SPEAKER1 1:53:37
Rocking back and forth. How long does it take? Sorry. Uh, yes. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:41
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 1:53:42
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:43
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER1 1:53:47
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 1:53:49
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER6 1:53:50
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:52
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 1:53:53
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:55
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 1:53:56
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER6 1:54:00
I'm sorry. How long does it take to attune to an item? 
SPEAKER4 1:54:02
Just about an hour. 
SPEAKER3 1:54:04
Oh. 
SPEAKER6 1:54:05
Oh, wait. Hold on. 
SPEAKER5 1:54:07
Make sure you remember this. 
SPEAKER3 1:54:08
What are you tryin' to do there, Jozert? Just looking at a ring? 
SPEAKER6 1:54:14
I don't know which one. 
SPEAKER2 1:54:17
Well, let's not make you any more useless, Signoria. 
SPEAKER3 1:54:19
I'm gonna toss this over to fucking Jozert. He's going to receive these draconic gloves of duality. Awesome. There it is. 
SPEAKER6 1:54:30
I'm lying. I didn't actually name it. 
SPEAKER5 1:54:35
I just don't know what you named him. Are they the spellcasting focus? Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 1:54:42
It's just the Dragon Touch spellcasting focus. 
SPEAKER5 1:54:44
But if you're going to name it Duality, do it. It's literally just gloves that I already have. 
SPEAKER6 1:54:51
Nope. These are very special attributes. 
SPEAKER2 1:54:55
Oh. Can you give me the link to those, Evan, so I can pass them over to him? 
SPEAKER3 1:55:00
But I got this fancy-looking ring. 
SPEAKER1 1:55:06
The ring will go great with these gloves. 
SPEAKER6 1:55:10
Trust me. 
SPEAKER5 1:55:11
Specially made for your tiny hands. 
SPEAKER6 1:55:13
I got adequate hands. You got fucking baby hands. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:18
I got adequate hands. There's a difference. 
SPEAKER6 1:55:22
I don't know. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:24
Just ask your mom. 
SPEAKER6 1:55:26
I would. 
SPEAKER5 1:55:28
But she's dead. 
SPEAKER3 1:55:30
Yeah, I know. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:39
I found her grave. 
SPEAKER3 1:55:43
I dug it up. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:46
With my adequate hands. 
SPEAKER5 1:55:51
Hey, you don't know how big my dick is. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:54
You were naked half of your fucking time. What do you mean I don't know what... I wasn't naked. I had pants on. 
SPEAKER3 1:56:00
Damn. 
SPEAKER5 1:56:02
Did you have pants on? 
SPEAKER6 1:56:04
I always had pants. 
SPEAKER2 1:56:05
I always had tight leather pants. 
SPEAKER5 1:56:06
During what point? 
SPEAKER4 1:56:10
I am so confused as to who's fucking whose mom at every point this is happening. 
SPEAKER6 1:56:15
Well, I fucked Jizzard's mom, then he got mad and tried to fuck my mom, but my mom died from unsatisfaction because he didn't have a big dick. I have adequate dick, and you don't know what dick I got, champ. 
SPEAKER3 1:56:26
Would we know Jizzard's dick size? 
SPEAKER2 1:56:30
Is that canon? 
SPEAKER5 1:56:30
No one would know my dick size. 
SPEAKER2 1:56:33
Only I know I have a tiny penis. 
SPEAKER6 1:56:35
Dude's got a fucking cloaca. 
SPEAKER2 1:56:37
Well, wait, isn't he in tight pants? So wouldn't we see, like, the outline of his bulge and then know that it's small? 
SPEAKER6 1:56:42
Or lack thereof. 
SPEAKER2 1:56:43
Where are these fucking gloves at, man? 
SPEAKER5 1:56:44
I am literally trying to send them to you, but the item won't open. 
SPEAKER2 1:56:49
What is the name of it? 
SPEAKER5 1:56:50
The world anvil. They are the dragon-touched focus. The focus can take whatever shape you want. 
SPEAKER4 1:56:57
You decided on gloves for Jizzard. 
SPEAKER2 1:56:59
Um. 
SPEAKER3 1:57:00
I got it. 
SPEAKER6 1:57:02
I have a dragon-touched codpiece.

Okay, then yes, it was stirring.

until theuden I'll try. 
SPEAKER2 2:00:08
Before he does, he's gonna look at... 
SPEAKER3 2:00:11
Fuck. I forgot what I named him. 
SPEAKER5 2:00:19
Ow. 
SPEAKER2 2:00:19
Ow. I'm sorry! I have so much shit going on. I'm gonna look at Alf. And he's gonna give him a little soft smile. 
SPEAKER6 2:00:35
A very sad, happy smile that he got to see him. 
SPEAKER2 2:00:42
And he's gonna try and rest. 
SPEAKER4 2:00:48
Alf, close down to your level and try to rest off your head. And heal through... Cure into your mind. The world has planned for you yet. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:05
That's kind of passive-aggressive Alf. 
SPEAKER5 2:01:08
The rest of you don't hear this. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:10
I know. 
SPEAKER4 2:01:11
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:13
I'm just judging Alf. 
SPEAKER4 2:01:15
You're just judging Alf? 
SPEAKER6 2:01:17
Yeah. I see him. 
SPEAKER5 2:01:18
Why are you judging him? 
SPEAKER6 2:01:20
I'm judging Alf because he's a little fart monster. 
SPEAKER4 2:01:24
Oh, he's a little fart monster. 
SPEAKER3 2:01:26
Yeah. Totally can't relate. He can't relate. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:29
Is Gizzard thinking this? 
SPEAKER2 2:01:31
Because the flumps can read thoughts, right? Do they hear Gizzard judging them? 
SPEAKER4 2:01:37
Yep. 
SPEAKER2 2:01:38
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 2:01:38
They have some level of awareness of their thoughts. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:41
And what do these bastards think of my thoughts? 
SPEAKER5 2:01:44
Well, it's a little judgy. You see one of the eyes roll over to you. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:49
There's the hipster one, like, not mellowing with my vibe. 
SPEAKER4 2:01:54
No. Not in fact mellowing with your vibe. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:56
Damn. It's like red dragon dude's giving me some weird vibes, Al. He's got like this whole aura about him that's just not chill, bro. 
SPEAKER3 2:02:16
I did no such thing. 
SPEAKER6 2:02:21
Michi's gonna look across the room. Are we rested? 
SPEAKER3 2:02:25
I don't know. Am I attuning to these gloves? 
SPEAKER6 2:02:33
Do I have them? 
SPEAKER5 2:02:37
They're not in my inventory. 
SPEAKER2 2:02:41
I did. I am. 
SPEAKER6 2:02:43
I'm seeing my two dragon printed sorcerer gloves that I've always had. 
SPEAKER5 2:02:49
Oh, is it supposed to be like... 
SPEAKER6 2:02:51
Devon probably didn't make the item properly, so I have to go in there and update. The whole fucking thing. 
SPEAKER3 2:03:03
Uh... I'll refresh your page. 
SPEAKER6 2:03:07
Oh, I'll refresh. Have I tried turning it off and back on again? 
SPEAKER5 2:03:12
Have you? 
SPEAKER6 2:03:13
No. You said to look in my inventory, and I looked in my inventory, and there was nothing new there. 
SPEAKER5 2:03:18
And you trusted me? 
SPEAKER6 2:03:21
And Michi explained her creation to this fucking dimwit. I'm trying to read the thing. It's stirring. Stirring focus has the slumbering property. Just throw more words I don't know. So, to make it simple on the easy jizzer, you get initiative advantage. While holding this, it acts as your spell focus. So, just wearing the fucking gloves, you have a spell focus. Now, if you cast, like, lightning, fire, or poison, etc., it goes on a chromatic. Everything else you can figure out. So, I just roll an extra d6 for whatever damage I... Oh, no. 
SPEAKER5 2:03:55
Wait. Chromatic or metallic? 
SPEAKER3 2:03:56
I'm both, though. 
SPEAKER6 2:03:58
Then you get both. Or am I... 
SPEAKER2 2:04:01
Am I... 
SPEAKER6 2:04:01
Am I both? 
SPEAKER2 2:04:03
How is my fucking thing coming along? 
SPEAKER3 2:04:06
You are still chromatic. 
SPEAKER4 2:04:08
You are awareness. 
SPEAKER6 2:04:09
You are... 
SPEAKER4 2:04:09
You do not know exactly what is causing the change. But it is now part of your arm that's changed. It looks like it's regressed back, and more of your arm is now turning back to the red. 
SPEAKER6 2:04:21
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 2:04:22
Wait. 
SPEAKER1 2:04:23
Wait. 
SPEAKER6 2:04:23
So, this is based on the property of the... The dragon who was slain. So... 
SPEAKER5 2:04:26
Yes. 
SPEAKER4 2:04:26
Which is still chromatic. So, both... 
SPEAKER5 2:04:29
In either way, it would have been chromatic. 
SPEAKER2 2:04:31
So, yeah. 
SPEAKER6 2:04:32
You rolled a d6 and gained a bonus equals to the rolled. 
SPEAKER1 2:04:36
So... 
SPEAKER6 2:04:37
Ooh, what the fuck's happened to my weird dragon body? 
SPEAKER5 2:04:41
I'm still exploring my body, guys. 
SPEAKER6 2:04:43
I'm sorry. This dragon's got some fucking alopecia. 
SPEAKER2 2:04:46
Ha! 
SPEAKER6 2:04:50
Wow. 
SPEAKER2 2:04:50
Oh. 
SPEAKER6 2:04:53
Oh, I'm confused. 
SPEAKER3 2:04:55
Alright. I guess I'll take this time to attune to the mystery gloves. 
SPEAKER6 2:05:07
Okay. I'll just kind of meditate on them. Even though I like my old ones. 
SPEAKER2 2:05:18
Maybe I'll just put them over the other ones. 
SPEAKER6 2:05:21
Don't worry. 
SPEAKER2 2:05:22
You can die to whatever color. 
SPEAKER6 2:05:25
They will adapt. I've got to find a fucking seamstress again to fucking customize this shit. 
SPEAKER4 2:05:32
As you attune to those gloves, they immediately ensue the size themselves. 
SPEAKER2 2:05:38
Ooh! Can I add effect to that? 
SPEAKER5 2:05:40
Sure. 
SPEAKER6 2:05:40
A little flavor text. 
SPEAKER2 2:05:41
Since they're chromatic, Jezzard can change the color of them at will. 
SPEAKER5 2:05:50
So, Jezzard, what color are your gloves? 
SPEAKER2 2:05:54
Uh... Uh... Uh... 
SPEAKER1 2:05:54
Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... 
SPEAKER6 2:05:54
Uh... One matches 
SPEAKER2 2:05:57
My skin tone and the other matches 
SPEAKER6 2:05:57
My other skin tone. 
SPEAKER5 2:05:59
Since... 
SPEAKER6 2:06:00
Since I have two different colored hands. You're wearing the flesh of a red dragon now. So, I guess I have a like a red one, and a gold one. 
SPEAKER4 2:06:14
Alright 
SPEAKER6 2:06:18
Neat. 
SPEAKER4 2:06:20
Horace, what are you up to during this short parentheses? 
SPEAKER1 2:06:23
Horace... Horace, what are you up to during this short Untimeknown should colors pretty much pretty much huh? Horace, what are you up to during this short parece... Text on screen Спenter is getting Vortec item. 
SPEAKER4 2:06:24

SPEAKER6 2:06:24
Text on screen Spenter is getting Plate Machooma code. 
SPEAKER5 2:06:25
is not a chat issue. 
SPEAKER6 2:06:27
I think she's still lagging. 
SPEAKER5 2:06:31
Okay. I also know that 
SPEAKER4 2:06:33
IRL uh Cora, do you need to leave around 
SPEAKER2 2:06:39
this time? Um, 
SPEAKER5 2:06:41
not, not like 
SPEAKER4 2:06:43
terribly. Um, 
SPEAKER2 2:06:45
yeah, I thought Cody's in Seattle right now, and I thought they 
SPEAKER1 2:06:49
might swing by her, but haven't messaged, so, uh, 
SPEAKER5 2:06:52
I am 
SPEAKER4 2:06:54
good for right now. 
SPEAKER6 2:06:57
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 2:06:59
I'm grilling a cheese 
SPEAKER6 2:07:01
for fours, and she's just resting it up. 
SPEAKER4 2:07:05
Okay, an hour passes. You are all completed your short rest. 
SPEAKER1 2:07:11
Undeterred. 
SPEAKER5 2:07:14
Well, 
SPEAKER4 2:07:16
undisturbed where you are. I will need everyone to make a perception check. 
SPEAKER6 2:07:20
Um, 
SPEAKER4 2:07:21
these tokens 
SPEAKER6 2:07:23
are so fungible right now. 
SPEAKER5 2:07:24
Goddamn. 
SPEAKER6 2:07:25
Excuse me? A perception check? 
SPEAKER2 2:07:27
They're what? What? Bitch, what do you say? They're fungible. Okay. Be fungible? That's not what I heard. 
SPEAKER6 2:07:37
Fungible. I need you to roll four fours, because I cannot. 
SPEAKER2 2:07:40
Oh, my god. 
SPEAKER6 2:07:42
Jesus. 
SPEAKER5 2:07:44
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:07:45
Well, I guess now of all times, it's okay to crit. 
SPEAKER5 2:07:48
Initiative, you say? Bam. 
SPEAKER6 2:07:52
No, perception. Perception. Okay. Oh. 
SPEAKER4 2:07:55
I'm bad at this game. 
SPEAKER5 2:07:57
I would cry if it was initiative. 
SPEAKER6 2:07:58
Oh, shit. 
SPEAKER5 2:07:59
It's the other P. 
SPEAKER6 2:08:02
Well, either way. Goddamn. 
SPEAKER5 2:08:04
I either got a natural. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:05
I got, we'll stick with this one. I got a natural one. 
SPEAKER6 2:08:10
Total of five. 
SPEAKER5 2:08:12
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:13
Gizzard was napping 
SPEAKER6 2:08:14
while attuning. 
SPEAKER5 2:08:17
That's worth them. 
SPEAKER4 2:08:19
All right. 
SPEAKER5 2:08:19
That is now the war. 
SPEAKER4 2:08:21
How do you attune to items? 
SPEAKER2 2:08:23
I nap. 
SPEAKER5 2:08:24
Yes. 
SPEAKER6 2:08:25
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:28
Well, I mean, 
SPEAKER5 2:08:29
that's how I attune to these ones. 
SPEAKER6 2:08:31
I figure that's how you lick things. You just constantly lick them. I attune to this one via napping, because sorcery is weird. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 2:08:44
All right. So, 
SPEAKER2 2:08:48
huh. 
SPEAKER5 2:08:50
Interesting. 
SPEAKER6 2:08:52
What's going on? 
SPEAKER4 2:08:54
In Songhong and Jimmy. In Songhong, you're the one who realistically hears it. Out and somewhere else in the cavern, you can hear the echoing of music. It's slight. It doesn't come your way. But other things are moving in space. 
SPEAKER3 2:09:14
Oh, no, they move it. 
SPEAKER4 2:09:20
With that, you're, you're... With that, 
SPEAKER1 2:09:24
you're long rest, 
SPEAKER4 2:09:26
or short rest, comes to account. You are fortified. You have regained some level of yourself and some level of confidence. You are still bottomless dark. Alone from the world. The better for it, more or less. For some of you, that's a good job. 
SPEAKER5 2:09:52
So, what are you all doing? 
SPEAKER1 2:09:54
I don't know. I don't know. 
SPEAKER5 2:09:58
I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 2:10:00
I don't know. 
SPEAKER2 2:10:01
I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 2:10:01
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. 
SPEAKER6 2:10:02
I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 2:10:02
I don't know. 
SPEAKER2 2:10:02
I think we better get some skedaddled. 
SPEAKER6 2:10:05
Were we skedaddling too? The fuck about this place? 
SPEAKER2 2:10:09
What do you think? How are we skedaddling the fuck up out of here, then? Back the same way we came. Clearly. It caved in, didn't it? I didn't hear that. 
SPEAKER6 2:10:19
I mean, I came down. 
SPEAKER2 2:10:22
It was still open when I came down. 
SPEAKER4 2:10:24
Oh, yeah. I don't know why I thought it caved in. 
SPEAKER3 2:10:28
I'm gonna ask the flump, is there an exit out of this cave that's faster and easier? 
SPEAKER4 2:10:34
The flump, as you ask it, in the present sense. No. You don't know what lies above. But no way to the above. I know of no path. I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER6 2:10:54
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:10:58
Is there anything we can do to stock up on supplies while we're here? 
SPEAKER4 2:11:04
Have you seen any loose items, possibly? 
SPEAKER6 2:11:08
We can help you? Help us help you? 
SPEAKER4 2:11:12
The flump wants to get answers. No. All that lies below is nature and death. You don't know what lies above. 
SPEAKER1 2:11:22
Understood. 
SPEAKER3 2:11:24
Huh. Well. 
SPEAKER2 2:11:28
Guys? Get the fuck outta here anytime, anybody? 
SPEAKER6 2:11:32
Michi's just gonna stare across the room. 
SPEAKER4 2:11:36
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 2:11:40
Yusonhan's gonna nod at that suggestion. 
SPEAKER3 2:11:44
Ah. Michi having been 
SPEAKER6 2:11:48
fuckin' diddled too many times. This place is gonna ready an attack while she walks 
SPEAKER1 2:11:52
towards the exit. 
SPEAKER3 2:11:56
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 2:12:00
So I'm holding an attack in reaction to Jackassery. 
SPEAKER4 2:12:04
Jackassery. Okay. I assume everyone is following? Sure. 
SPEAKER2 2:12:12
Yusonhan will follow. He's gonna be really cautious in this time, too. Like, kinda on the lookout for anything possibly coming their way. 
SPEAKER4 2:12:20
Okay. The jigs will... 
SPEAKER6 2:12:28
silently follow. 
SPEAKER4 2:12:32
Can Janoon make... ... Can Janoon make an... 
SPEAKER2 2:12:44
Can Janoon make an... ... 
SPEAKER6 2:12:48
...acrobatics check to see if he can stand on his own? 
SPEAKER4 2:12:52
... 
SPEAKER2 2:12:54
Go ahead, make an acrobatics check. Could it be acrobatics? 
SPEAKER5 2:12:56
Oh. It would be acrobatics or athletics. 
SPEAKER4 2:12:58
... Yeah. ... ... Janoon... 
SPEAKER5 2:13:08
And Michi, you've seen this before, 
SPEAKER4 2:13:10
as you are getting ready for the space. He watches Janoon... ...tries to struggle to get himself on... ...cross himself off the wall. And then... 
SPEAKER5 2:13:20
...instinctively leans to put a step forward 
SPEAKER4 2:13:22
for a leg that's half-mare. And tumbles and falls to the ground. Michi, you've seen this before. Not necessarily... This is a familiar process that you've seen before. ... ... 
SPEAKER1 2:13:36
Hm. 
SPEAKER6 2:13:38
Very well. 
SPEAKER3 2:13:40
Very well. 
SPEAKER2 2:13:42
And we will just continue... 
SPEAKER1 2:13:44
...call over the... 
SPEAKER2 2:13:46
...the masters and just continue forward with them then. 
SPEAKER6 2:13:48
Once for...once again then. 
SPEAKER3 2:13:50
... ... How can we get Janoon out of here? ... 
SPEAKER6 2:13:58
She has dogs. They can drag her. Like, up that narrow... ...tunnel? 
SPEAKER3 2:14:04
They're dogs. They have all-wheel drive. 
SPEAKER6 2:14:06
... 
SPEAKER3 2:14:08
... ... ... 
SPEAKER2 2:14:14
Well, once we get to the full vertical, then we can worry about that, but that's only up near the 
SPEAKER6 2:14:18
very, very end. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:20
... 
SPEAKER1 2:14:22
Yeah? I guess so. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:24
... 
SPEAKER6 2:14:26
For now, the dogs can drag with a rope. But getting there is 
SPEAKER2 2:14:30
probably a good option. Anybody? I'm getting the lancy in this little area. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:34
... 
SPEAKER6 2:14:36
Is Janoon being dragged, or just, like, slumped over 
SPEAKER3 2:14:38
them? 
SPEAKER2 2:14:40
...Sitting on, like, a saddle. Like, dead. Oh. ... So, the thing I'm imagining Janoon is... So, at first I was, like, thinking, like, saddled on there, but then, like, duh. He's missing a lay...He's literally missing like, the opposite, like, literally- Shut the fuck up. ... Literally, horizontally, like, across- the limbs across from each other. Which makes it ten times harder. ... And so, the best way I'm thinking of it now is that he's literally just, like, slumped over, like, on his belly, hanging over one of them. Does that make sense? 
SPEAKER5 2:15:29
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 2:15:30
Oh, my. Well, she'll be fine. 
SPEAKER2 2:15:36
I mean, I could cut off the other limbs and heal at it or cauterize it. And you can fit quite easily that way. Janune will start to growl and hiss like a feral cat. 
SPEAKER6 2:15:51
You'd never know I would. You'd know I wouldn't. But we will find a way. 
SPEAKER2 2:15:58
I mean, I have an idea. I did it to Force. 
SPEAKER6 2:16:03
Oh, no. Actually, Force, you're going to have to figure out this one. My friend. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:14
What? 
SPEAKER4 2:16:16
As you guys find your way. 
SPEAKER5 2:16:19
Actually, I'll let Kaylin. 
SPEAKER4 2:16:20
You finish up your moment. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:22
Oh, no. 
SPEAKER6 2:16:22
I was just. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:23
Do you want it? 
SPEAKER4 2:16:25
We all have this discussion. I can't wait to meet the other clubs. I can go about my business. Whatever it might be. I have nothing. I'm going to try to do this. It makes it so. I'm going to try to do this. 
SPEAKER5 2:17:07
That's where we're going to end the session. 
SPEAKER2 2:17:09
Yay. 
SPEAKER5 2:17:10
Damn. 
SPEAKER2 2:17:13
Early.
