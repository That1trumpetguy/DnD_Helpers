SPEAKER7 0:00:00
Devin's own definition, buff chicks have boobs, therefore buff boob meat. 
SPEAKER1 0:00:05
Yeah, if a chick really works out, she's a strong cat. 
SPEAKER7 0:00:12
Michi's gonna run a fucking greatsword. I think she's buff enough. 
SPEAKER1 0:00:15
Okay, from a technical perspective, the human body is made up of muscle and fat tissue. And when you think of stuff like bacon, where you have the meat and the fat, you eat both. And it's considered just meat. So it can be more gelatinous in the way that it moves, but by definition it is meat. Okay, anyways, Michi's gonna look at Janoon, who's fucking touching a son of a bull, and be like, Oh, what do you got here? I got it. Can I say hi to the friend? Hi, friend! 
SPEAKER7 0:00:49
And I'm just gonna kind of like reach out slowly to kind of poke at its little jelliness. 
SPEAKER3 0:00:55
Pancake man! As you reach out and say all of this, one of the eye stalks stays on Janoon, and one of them just kind of rotates to you and then lowers to kind of the face level. And you're looking at it now. The entire thing, it is gelatinous. It is a floating gelatinous disc. Kind of reminiscent of a jellyfish, yeah. But like a little bit more solid. You don't necessarily see everything on the inside, but you do see the inside organelles shifting and moving. You do see... There is... Like... 
SPEAKER5 0:01:28
The way it's floating... 
SPEAKER3 0:01:29
It's jetting air out the bottom. 
SPEAKER5 0:01:31
And it doesn't smell great. This entire thing doesn't smell great. 
SPEAKER3 0:01:35
Like, it is smelling like it's passing gas the entire time. 
SPEAKER7 0:01:41
Michi's gonna fucking chuckle. 
SPEAKER3 0:01:43
Just like... 
SPEAKER1 0:01:44
Guess what? 
SPEAKER7 0:01:45
And she's gonna reach back and grab Big Mike. 
SPEAKER1 0:01:47
It smells just like you! It's your friend! It must be family! He's gonna say... 
SPEAKER7 0:01:53
He's gonna say, 
SPEAKER6 0:01:55
Hey, hey, hey, hey! 
SPEAKER5 0:01:56
I don't know what the fuck this is! 
SPEAKER3 0:01:58
I'm not related. 
SPEAKER5 0:01:59
It ain't familiar. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:01
It ain't familiar. The flump... As you are having this discussion through both of your minds... You get the same sort of enthusiastic curiosity just reflected back at you. And then it kind of gives a... The entire thing looks around... Like, one of the eyestalks, the one that's on you, Janine, looks at the rest of the figures in the room. And for the rest of you, you all feel... This sense of... Curiosity... And newness. Just through all of your minds. And then it kind of... Pauses and questions. There's a... 
SPEAKER5 0:02:44
There's a question there. 
SPEAKER7 0:02:45
It doesn't know something. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:46
It's questioning intent. Is the feeling you all get. It's questioning why you're there. Well... Uh... 
SPEAKER7 0:03:02
I... I... 
SPEAKER1 0:03:04
I'm unsure. 
SPEAKER3 0:03:05
Well... 
SPEAKER2 0:03:06
Moving on! 
SPEAKER3 0:03:07
As that happens... Give me a sec. I fucked something up. Okay, cool. I need... 
SPEAKER4 0:03:19
You highlighted the thing. 
SPEAKER1 0:03:21
I did. 
SPEAKER3 0:03:22
Thank you. Very astute observation. Yeah. Another one pops out of another crevice in the wall towards you, Michi. And kind of just floats up right up to you. This one... You hear a... A... 
SPEAKER5 0:03:40
A... 
SPEAKER3 0:03:41
Pfff... 
SPEAKER5 0:03:42
Of gas as it lowers itself to your eye level. 
SPEAKER3 0:03:43
And then both eyes meet with you. 
SPEAKER7 0:03:45
Little Farterton. Hi. Okay... 
SPEAKER3 0:03:49
We... 
SPEAKER2 0:03:50
We... We... 
SPEAKER7 0:03:52
We... Which... 
SPEAKER1 0:03:54
Which... 
SPEAKER7 0:03:55
Which... Which... 
SPEAKER3 0:03:57
Which... Which... 
SPEAKER5 0:03:59
And then another one... 
SPEAKER3 0:04:00
Comes out of the crevice. Up to Janoon. And now there are... There are four of them that you can see. Three of them are kind of just surrounding you and Janoon, Michi. 
SPEAKER1 0:04:15
Nuh-uh. 
SPEAKER4 0:04:16
There's too many of these fucking things. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:17
Can you describe the symphony of farts that we hear echoing through the chamber right now? 
SPEAKER5 0:04:22
Right now, it's not like a... 
SPEAKER3 0:04:23
It's not a rawner... 
SPEAKER5 0:04:24
A sonorous symphony of, like, wet, meaty farts. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:26
This is kind of... This is kind of like... You're kind of hearing a constant silent death type of fart. If anything, it's kind of like the... 
SPEAKER5 0:04:30
The off-gassing of a small, like, um... 
SPEAKER3 0:04:31
Not air compressor, but like air valve. Like an air valve for a pump. Where it's just this calm, like, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof. 
SPEAKER5 0:04:34
Yep. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:35
As it kind of floats and... And hovers in the area. And all three of them just kind of come out and they're... They're just looking at you right now. 
SPEAKER2 0:04:39
Looking and... 
SPEAKER3 0:04:40
You get a feeling they're trying to listen. They're trying to... They're trying to... They're trying to... They're trying to... 
SPEAKER7 0:04:45
They're trying to... 
SPEAKER3 0:04:46
They're trying to... They're trying to... They're trying to... Listen. Listen to your thoughts. Not as if they're trying to cry. They're just sitting, listening. In Sanheng. What are you doing during this time? 
SPEAKER1 0:05:12
Jesus Christ, that sound. Holy shit. 
SPEAKER5 0:05:16
I will lower it if I can. 
SPEAKER2 0:05:19
Um... 
SPEAKER1 0:05:20
Yeah, Isanhan is... He's been watching this whole time. With just, like... 
SPEAKER3 0:05:26
I don't know. Dread. 
SPEAKER1 0:05:28
Dread. 
SPEAKER3 0:05:29
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 0:05:30
And confusion. Curiosity. 
SPEAKER3 0:05:32
Yeah, he's always curious. 
SPEAKER1 0:05:33
Um... 
SPEAKER3 0:05:34
But mostly just... 
SPEAKER1 0:05:35
Uh... 
SPEAKER3 0:05:36
Fear. 
SPEAKER1 0:05:37
As he's, like, huddled still in his little hut. Just, like, fucking staring at these things like this. 
SPEAKER3 0:05:42
Um... And... 
SPEAKER1 0:05:44
Ah! Wait, let me look at the range on the hut again. He's gonna go... Kind of, like, to the edge wall... Of his, like, little barrier. And try to kind of squint at these things. And... 
SPEAKER2 0:05:58
Just see, like... 
SPEAKER1 0:05:59
What the heck they... What the fuck are these things? 
SPEAKER2 0:06:01
Just make sure your little bubble is 15 feet, right? 
SPEAKER1 0:06:02
It's a 10 foot radius. So I think I can move kind of, like... 
SPEAKER3 0:06:04
One little bit? 
SPEAKER1 0:06:05
Right, yeah. 
SPEAKER5 0:06:06
Like, right here. So he sees... 
SPEAKER3 0:06:08
Yeah. Three of these. 
SPEAKER1 0:06:10
One extra kind of in the dark. And he's just like... What the fuck? 
SPEAKER3 0:06:13
He's mostly just scared. 
SPEAKER1 0:06:14
But curious. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:16
He's like, what the fuck? 
SPEAKER1 0:06:17
He's like, what the fuck? He's like, what the fuck? He's like, what the fuck? 
SPEAKER5 0:06:20
He's like, what the fuck? 
SPEAKER1 0:06:21
He's like, what the fuck? 
SPEAKER2 0:06:22
He's like, what the fuck? 
SPEAKER1 0:06:23
He's like, what the fuck? 
SPEAKER3 0:06:24
He's mostly just scared, but curious. Hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:06:29
Maybe a tiny bit excited, because he's finally really exploring some things. 
SPEAKER2 0:06:37
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:39
You see them floating there, just kind of hanging in this space. 
SPEAKER2 0:06:47
Just questioning. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:48
If... 
SPEAKER1 0:06:49
I guess, since he's like, kind of watching them so closely and trying to find them, he's trying to figure out what the fuck they're doing and what the heck these things even are, and what they're all about. Could you like, try to kind of roll perception to kind of be like, just gauge details from 
SPEAKER3 0:07:04
them? 
SPEAKER5 0:07:05
Sure. 
SPEAKER3 0:07:06
Roll a perception check. 
SPEAKER1 0:07:07
Yippee. 
SPEAKER2 0:07:08
Okay. Woo! 
SPEAKER3 0:07:10
So with the dirty 20, here's what you get. Here's what you gather. Um. They are coming from two different worlds. Okay. They are coming from two cracks in the wall. They're kind of just floating out, and they're... 
SPEAKER5 0:07:28
The behavior that they're giving, the body language, even if this weird alien type of 
SPEAKER3 0:07:32
construction, doesn't really say hostile. You can tell they're... One is touching Janoon, but Janoon hasn't really reacted. Michi and the two of them, while they are talking to each other, and Michi's talking to Big Mike, they are just kind of staring at these creatures as well. Right? And you get the figure that they're also... There's some sort of telepathic link going on. Um. 
SPEAKER7 0:07:56
Alliterate that. I was only just making a comment while holding him, not actually talking to him in his language. 
SPEAKER3 0:08:02
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So you heard Michi make a comment to Big Mike. Um. You figure a bunch... Like there are four now. There might be more where they came from. But the other thing... The other thing that sticks out about this is... There's probably an additional space from where they are. Right? So you now have branching paths. The last thing you notice is you hear shuffling in the distance off to your character's left. And the beginning of a trail of red in the distance in the same direction. Um. 
SPEAKER1 0:08:40
He's gonna kind of like pat the ground and make like cooing kind of like bird sounds, like trolling bird sounds to try to like get someone's attention. And he's gonna be like pointing to that... 
SPEAKER2 0:08:51
Uh... 
SPEAKER7 0:08:52
Trail. 
SPEAKER3 0:08:53
Which I think... 
SPEAKER2 0:08:54
How do I ping? It's like... 
SPEAKER1 0:08:56
You gotta hold the mouse button. 
SPEAKER2 0:08:57
Hold click. Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:08:59
Okay. He's... 
SPEAKER1 0:09:01
Oh my god. 
SPEAKER3 0:09:02
Yeah. He's pointing kind of like this direction. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:08
Okay. That's... 
SPEAKER3 0:09:10
That's pretty good. 
SPEAKER1 0:09:11
That's pretty good. 
SPEAKER3 0:09:12
I think... I think... 
SPEAKER2 0:09:14
I think... I think... I think... I think... I think... I think... 
SPEAKER3 0:09:20
I think... 
SPEAKER2 0:09:21
I think... Uh... Uh... I think... 
SPEAKER3 0:09:25
Uh... 
SPEAKER5 0:09:26
I think... 
SPEAKER3 0:09:27
I think... I think... I think... 
SPEAKER2 0:09:30
I think... I think it is... 
SPEAKER3 0:09:32
Okay. So the ship is moving right ahead. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:35
And it's moving... Good. So. 
SPEAKER3 0:09:38
The ship is probably moving in one of these direction. 
SPEAKER2 0:09:45
I dunno. 
SPEAKER3 0:09:48
Just hope... 
SPEAKER7 0:09:49
I really don't, but... Cool. Very cool. 
SPEAKER2 0:10:49
Okay, cool. 
SPEAKER3 0:10:58
At the top, I'm going to need everyone at this point... To make a perception check. Including you, Forrest. 
SPEAKER2 0:11:13
Okay... 
SPEAKER1 0:11:14
14. Sorry, that's persuading. Ignore the top when I accidentally click persuasion. 
SPEAKER6 0:11:23
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:11:26
Okay, time. I can't see shit. 
SPEAKER7 0:11:35
You said which one? Perception? 
SPEAKER6 0:11:36
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER7 0:11:43
That is a 20. 
SPEAKER5 0:11:44
Beautiful, beautiful. 
SPEAKER3 0:11:49
Ord, you gonna roll perception over here? 
SPEAKER4 0:11:54
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 0:11:54
Oh, sorry. 
SPEAKER2 0:11:57
Let me see. 
SPEAKER3 0:12:04
Beautiful. So, Michi and Forrest, you pick up on this first. As you hear the bird kind of cooing and patting the ground behind you, and look in the same direction, as you hear... 
SPEAKER1 0:12:18
What did you do? 
SPEAKER6 0:12:19
Um... 
SPEAKER3 0:12:20
Nope. Not yet. 
SPEAKER1 0:12:22
I haven't... 
SPEAKER3 0:12:23
Yes. I'm going order from highest roll to lowest. 
SPEAKER1 0:12:27
You'll be up here soon. Oh, sorry. I was looking at their persuasion. My bad. 
SPEAKER6 0:12:31
Yeah. So... 
SPEAKER3 0:12:33
Michi and Forrest, you immediately pick up on the patting, the cooing. You look in the direction, and you see it now, too. 
SPEAKER5 0:12:41
Kind of surprised you didn't. There's a trail of red. 
SPEAKER3 0:12:44
Dried red that leads around a corner in the rock. And from that same direction, you hear footsteps. Large footsteps. 
SPEAKER5 0:12:52
And a dragging. 
SPEAKER3 0:12:54
Something against stone. Something being dragged haphazardly. Something's coming. 
SPEAKER5 0:13:01
You don't know what it is. 
SPEAKER3 0:13:02
Whatever it is, it's big. Janoon, you're a little bit... You're a second behind. You see Michi look over, 
SPEAKER5 0:13:10
and what kind of sets you off is that all the flumps, 
SPEAKER3 0:13:12
their eye stalks, come off of each other, and then all look in the same direction. And they all start kind of... moving much quicker around each other. And the one that has its tendril in your hand retracts it. 
SPEAKER1 0:13:30
So we can infer that whatever that noise is, the creatures aren't with it because they seem surprised, too. 
SPEAKER6 0:13:40
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 0:13:40
And you don't need to infer much more 
SPEAKER3 0:13:41
because your staff of warning that you've been using this entire time, which, after you killed the roper, went from a rapid strobe... back to a low, like, pulsing, that pulsing is picked up again. It's faster and faster with each step that comes by. 
SPEAKER5 0:13:59
From now, we'll be in solid initiative order. Forz, you're at the top of the initiative. What are you up to? 
SPEAKER1 0:14:05
Cool. I am going to... press myself back into the side and basically make myself as small as I can and bonus action to hide. 
SPEAKER6 0:14:18
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:14:19
Um... 
SPEAKER6 0:14:20
Yeah. And I'll go from there. 
SPEAKER1 0:14:22
Do I need to roll stealth? Yes, please. Um... 
SPEAKER3 0:14:25
I actually... 
SPEAKER6 0:14:26
I'm assuming that I don't have the... 
SPEAKER1 0:14:27
I'm assuming I don't have the elvenkind yet, uh, still, because I was in the thing. So, actually, I'm gonna pull the hood up of that, which is an action, so I get advantage on the stealth to hide. 
SPEAKER6 0:14:32
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:14:33
So basically, I want to make myself completely invisible. 24. Okay. So, I'm gonna roll stealth. I'm gonna roll stealth. I'm gonna roll stealth. I'm gonna roll stealth. I'm gonna roll stealth. I'm gonna roll stealth. 
SPEAKER4 0:14:42
I'm gonna roll stealth. 
SPEAKER1 0:14:43
I'm gonna roll stealth. I'm gonna roll stealth. I'm gonna roll stealth. 
SPEAKER4 0:14:46
I'm gonna roll stealth. I'm gonna roll stealth. 
SPEAKER2 0:14:48
Completely invisible. 
SPEAKER1 0:14:49
24. Um... And since that took an action, I will not hold my action. 
SPEAKER4 0:14:53
I will just... 
SPEAKER1 0:14:54
hide for now, and hope that I don't regret that. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:59
Cool! 
SPEAKER6 0:15:01
That's your turn. 
SPEAKER3 0:15:02
Janune, what are you up to? 
SPEAKER1 0:15:05
Um... The first thing I'm gonna do... 
SPEAKER6 0:15:13
Um... Well, what... 
SPEAKER1 0:15:21
I think our best bet is to run, guys. You see how the little fellas are reacting. It's clearly not with them. We should probably go. Or hide. 
SPEAKER7 0:15:34
You're right. I agree. This doesn't look good. 
SPEAKER1 0:15:38
Quite frankly, I'm not looking too good myself, so... Which way do you think we should go? I think our little buddies might know a little spot. What do you think? 
SPEAKER7 0:15:50
They don't look like they're here to harm us. 
SPEAKER1 0:15:52
They might know a good place to hide. 
SPEAKER5 0:15:54
Well, perhaps you're right. 
SPEAKER3 0:15:58
To noon or... 
SPEAKER1 0:15:59
Reach his paw out to one of the... To the pancake right next to him. He's gonna call the pancake right next to him, Alf. 
SPEAKER3 0:16:09
Mm-hmm. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:11
He's gonna reach... 
SPEAKER1 0:16:12
Reach out his paw to Alf. Uh... Do you know the safest way? The safest way away from whatever's... Coming this... 
SPEAKER2 0:16:26
Coming... 
SPEAKER3 0:16:27
As you reach your paw out and kind of... Ask that question... It thinks back... 
SPEAKER2 0:16:34
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 0:16:35
Follow us. To you and Michi and to... 
SPEAKER5 0:16:41
Let's see. 
SPEAKER3 0:16:42
Ord, Insunghang, and Jizzard. Fours, you are hidden, so... 
SPEAKER7 0:16:48
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:16:50
Insunghang. 
SPEAKER5 0:16:51
Little... Little side note. You would know with the spell that you have active, it will last for eight hours. Things cannot... Things that you do that are hostile, 
SPEAKER3 0:16:57
that were not in the bubble when you cast it, 
SPEAKER5 0:17:00
cannot come back into it. However, once you leave the area, 
SPEAKER3 0:17:03
that bubble is gone. 
SPEAKER7 0:17:05
Yes. 
SPEAKER5 0:17:06
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:17:07
Cool. Just checking. 
SPEAKER6 0:17:10
So... 
SPEAKER3 0:17:10
Janoon, on your turn, 
SPEAKER5 0:17:12
Janoon, when you do... 
SPEAKER7 0:17:12
When you do that, 
SPEAKER3 0:17:13
all of the flump, these creatures now, 
SPEAKER5 0:17:17
they begin to move back towards the crevices 
SPEAKER3 0:17:21
in which they came from. 
SPEAKER5 0:17:23
They are narrow crevices, 
SPEAKER3 0:17:24
but you can fit through them, one at a time. So, do you want to go for the one that's here, or the one that's here? 
SPEAKER1 0:17:36
They don't all go towards one specifically, they just all go towards... 
SPEAKER6 0:17:40
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER5 0:17:40
They kind of split up a little bit. 
SPEAKER6 0:17:42
I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 0:17:46
I will go... 
SPEAKER7 0:17:49
this way. 
SPEAKER5 0:17:52
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:17:55
Alf follows. 
SPEAKER5 0:17:58
You do see another flump there 
SPEAKER3 0:18:00
that also evacuates back in the direction. 
SPEAKER1 0:18:04
Oh, hello. 
SPEAKER5 0:18:07
Do you want to go through the crevice? 
SPEAKER7 0:18:11
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:18:12
Okay, cool. 
SPEAKER5 0:18:15
You can see through there, right? 
SPEAKER1 0:18:16
I think I'm accidentally controlling floors 
SPEAKER7 0:18:18
as well, for some reason. Yeah, I probably slowed control from last time. 
SPEAKER6 0:18:24
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 0:18:27
That was long ago. 
SPEAKER6 0:18:30
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 0:18:31
Okay, let me go ahead and make that not a thing. Thank you. 
SPEAKER6 0:18:35
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 0:18:40
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER6 0:18:40
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER5 0:18:45
Configure ownership. Yeah, you're no longer the owner. 
SPEAKER3 0:18:51
Save. 
SPEAKER5 0:18:52
There you go. 
SPEAKER1 0:18:52
Yeah, I moved to noon, and it was moving floors, too. I'm like, oh. 
SPEAKER5 0:18:56
Yoink. 
SPEAKER3 0:18:56
Shit. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:18:58
Sorry. 
SPEAKER7 0:18:58
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 0:19:00
Cool. You can move into the crevice. Okay. All right. I need to not start. I need to keep not start measuring things. You move further into the crevice. Okay. That part is difficult terrain, so you move what? Five, 10, 15, 20, 25. Yep. So you're just barely in. Cool. That is your turn. 
SPEAKER5 0:19:24
Gizzard, what are you up to? 
SPEAKER4 0:19:25
I'm still loud. Could Gizzard fit in this little, like, behind the crystals? 
SPEAKER5 0:19:33
You can kind of climb up to it, yes. 
SPEAKER3 0:19:35
You'll be climbed on top of the crystal strut. 
SPEAKER4 0:19:38
I can't get behind them. 
SPEAKER3 0:19:40
Mm-mm. 
SPEAKER4 0:19:42
I don't know what the bird's bubble's all about, so I'm going to avoid that. I'm going to walk past Ord, and on the way, tell him to follow me or something, and, like, grab his arm, Ord consenting to being grappled by wrist. 
SPEAKER3 0:20:08
That's up to Ord. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:10
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 0:20:11
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:20:12
Jake. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:16
It's my turn. Oh. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:18
I was asking if you consent to being grabbed by wrist. Yeah, yes, yes. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:22
Okay. I have a feeling it's that fucking fat-ass dragon from, from, uh... Thumberchod? That big, fat, red dragon. 
SPEAKER7 0:20:32
I don't remember his name. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:35
Another one from the Dungeons & Dragons movie? 
SPEAKER1 0:20:37
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:38
Yeah, that was Thumberchod. The big, fat... 
SPEAKER1 0:20:41
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:42
So, I'm going to, like, get here, because I can hear that it's coming from here, right? 
SPEAKER1 0:20:47
Whatever it is. 
SPEAKER6 0:20:48
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:50
So, yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:50
I'm going to drag Ord to kind of, like, behind these rocks a bit. Still, like, some vision of the cave itself. I kind of can't... 
SPEAKER1 0:21:01
Can I move along a little bit? Yeah. I don't know how to move. Ord. 
SPEAKER3 0:21:09
I don't know how to move. 
SPEAKER5 0:21:10
So, if you're... If you're dragging Ord... We're moving at half speed. So, you move... 
SPEAKER3 0:21:14
10... 15, 20, 25, 30. This is about as far as you can get. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:21
Where I am, or... 
SPEAKER3 0:21:22
Where you are, yes. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:23
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:21:24
So, you're still in the cavern. 
SPEAKER3 0:21:25
You're not necessarily behind any rocks. There is a small, craggly, um... 
SPEAKER5 0:21:30
offshoot that you can go through. 
SPEAKER3 0:21:32
A very narrow offshoot. But you're not through there yet. 
SPEAKER4 0:21:36
So, I guess Gizzard is still in the process of... moving to a hiding location. 
SPEAKER3 0:21:42
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:44
Uh, question for clarification. 
SPEAKER5 0:21:47
Yes. 
SPEAKER6 0:21:48
Um... 
SPEAKER1 0:21:48
These, uh, pancake creatures... 
SPEAKER3 0:21:51
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:51
Are they physically talking, or are they mind-talking? 
SPEAKER3 0:21:55
They have not made an actual sound. It's all been in your mind. 
SPEAKER1 0:21:59
Okay. 
SPEAKER7 0:22:00
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 0:22:03
Okay. That's that one. That one already moved. Cool. Cool. 
SPEAKER7 0:22:11
Which one? 
SPEAKER6 0:22:12
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 0:22:12
It's this one. 
SPEAKER6 0:22:16
Ah! 
SPEAKER3 0:22:17
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 0:22:20
15, 20... 25... 
SPEAKER2 0:22:24
It's... 
SPEAKER4 0:22:25
Now I can hear the dice rolling. 
SPEAKER5 0:22:26
It's from here you hear the thumping, 
SPEAKER3 0:22:28
and it's... It accelerates. 
SPEAKER5 0:22:32
Michi, roll Perception. Or, roll Perception. Gizzard. 
SPEAKER4 0:22:39
Gizzard? 
SPEAKER5 0:22:39
Roll Perception. 
SPEAKER6 0:22:40
Perception. 
SPEAKER1 0:22:40
Okay. 
SPEAKER7 0:22:41
Uh, yep. 
SPEAKER1 0:22:42
That is... 
SPEAKER7 0:22:43
A solid 19 for Michi. 
SPEAKER1 0:22:44
11. 
SPEAKER3 0:22:45
That's an 18 for Holden. 
SPEAKER7 0:22:46
That's okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:22:47
This one wasn't being as stealthy as the other one. 
SPEAKER5 0:22:48
What you see around that corner is you're kind of trying to move into a place that is not 
SPEAKER3 0:22:57
in that direction. Whereas you're trying to hide, you hear the thumping. You hear the exodus, because it's a jog. And then from around the corner you see this tall, almost ogre-ish type figure erupt from around the corner. And then... It's... It's skin a sickest purple hue, carrying one large wooden log-type deal behind it. A club fashioned out of stone and rock haphazardly put together. Its eyes glazed over as it stares at you, and then lets out a roar. 
SPEAKER5 0:23:29
Now that we're in Initiative, truly... 
SPEAKER1 0:23:32
Did we know that it saw them, though? Oh, it saw them. Did everybody hear that? 
SPEAKER5 0:23:37
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 0:23:38
Everyone hears this. 
SPEAKER1 0:23:39
I'm assuming I don't see it, but I can hear the roar. 
SPEAKER3 0:23:42
Oh, you see it. 
SPEAKER5 0:23:43
Or, you hear it. You hear it. 
SPEAKER1 0:23:45
Wait, does Isonghan not see it? Nope. 
SPEAKER3 0:23:49
It is around the corner that you cannot see around. Oh, okay, okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:23:52
I don't see it either. I don't. 
SPEAKER4 0:23:54
I don't either. 
SPEAKER7 0:23:55
Can I see it? 
SPEAKER4 0:23:56
Oh, is it that, this thing, like, way back here? 
SPEAKER3 0:23:59
Mm-hmm. Oh, wait. 
SPEAKER4 0:24:01
Oh, so I can barely see that. Oh, yeah. 
SPEAKER7 0:24:04
Okay, now I can see it. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 0:24:06
It's, like, just outside my light range. Oh, it's just... 
SPEAKER1 0:24:08
I was just thinking I can't see it in game, because he's in the corner. 
SPEAKER2 0:24:13
So he's trying to get out. 
SPEAKER1 0:24:14
I can barely see this thing. 
SPEAKER3 0:24:16
You can barely see something in the darkness as it comes out, barreling out and roaring at you. Michi, you get the good look at this thing, because you can see as if it's daytime, essentially. With that, it is going to use its action, and I need to get... 
SPEAKER1 0:24:34
Actually, quick question on seeing it. Yes. You cannot see it because it's around a corner, right? Yes. Because I do currently have darkvision? 
SPEAKER3 0:24:40
Yes, you cannot see it because it's around a corner. 
SPEAKER2 0:24:43
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:24:44
Just because if, like, I don't... I'm assuming that you have made the map so that it will... Yes. ...calculate for darkvision. Can you just let me know when it, like... When I would actually be able to see it? 
SPEAKER3 0:24:55
Mm-hmm. You'll be able to see it once it's in your range. You have darkvision up to 30 feet, right? 
SPEAKER1 0:25:02
I have whatever the elf darkvision is. But since that toggles with race as I change, I don't have it permanently on my character. No, that's okay. So it won't... 
SPEAKER3 0:25:11
I don't have the mechanics of it. Do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
SPEAKER5 0:25:18
Darkvision 60 feet. 
SPEAKER3 0:25:19
There we go. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:25:23
So you should be able to, with your character, see on the map. 
SPEAKER3 0:25:26
Like, you can see the map, right? 
SPEAKER1 0:25:28
Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:25:31
You just put something on and I can see more now. Yes. 
SPEAKER1 0:25:33
Okay. Thank you. 
SPEAKER7 0:25:35
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:25:36
Cool. Cool. 
SPEAKER3 0:25:38
Now, let me get some things going. Cool, cool, cool, cool. It is going to use its action to dash. Oh, God. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. Oh, God. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:03
What's this? 
SPEAKER3 0:26:04
5, 10, 15, 20, 25. Up to you, Ord. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:06
Hell yeah. It's fucking quite cool, bro. 
SPEAKER4 0:26:08
As this sickly purple... Kind of looks like a large... 
SPEAKER2 0:26:10
Like a mini giant that is just craggly and all sorts of fucked up, essentially. 
SPEAKER3 0:26:11
And as it dashes towards you, you notice it has no eyes, where the eyes should be, where the face should be. 
SPEAKER5 0:26:31
And it is a humanistic form. 
SPEAKER3 0:26:32
It's not giant. There's nothing. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:34
All right. 
SPEAKER3 0:26:35
But it's going to dash up to you, screaming, and it is your turn. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:36
Are you giving me a rendition of what that scream sounds like? 
SPEAKER3 0:26:41
No. My neighbors will hate me. It's got a log, and it's... Okay.

Oh, my God.

SPEAKER7 0:29:32
same time does it have the same reminiscent smell of the corpses of 
SPEAKER2 0:29:36

SPEAKER3 0:29:52
oh their bodies didn't explode but no this is different as well okay when 
SPEAKER5 0:30:01
though when you killed them that was very much a a mortal living body that was closer to the physiology of what the creatures were that had died and then a 
SPEAKER3 0:30:12
black a rotting brine smell this does 
SPEAKER2 0:30:15
not smell does not give off that same smell 
SPEAKER3 0:30:21
however that is be partially partially interesting that is a that is kind of an interesting note the this area does give off a slight tinge of that smell the cave itself meet she's gonna take a 
SPEAKER7 0:30:36
second and with the graceful hand touch or on the shoulder don't put your guard down as she casts guidance on him giving him a little extra boosty-boosty but if this creature is still fucking alive I need you to do a wisdom saving throw please now the creature is not alive 
SPEAKER2 0:31:00

SPEAKER7 0:31:21
one-d4 in your roles by the way the 
SPEAKER3 0:31:23
flump that is in front of you this one now is the alien thing moves far moves into the crevice it came out of and the next one already moved already moved oh no nope this one didn't so it's also going to make a beeline into one of the crevices in front of you Michi it signaled that that was some sort of safe space but even though you filled whatever creature might have been there they're still moving I think we 
SPEAKER2 0:32:10
should with boys which birds us to in 
SPEAKER3 0:32:13

SPEAKER7 0:32:27
in his dome and kind of go around the 
SPEAKER4 0:32:33
corner and just try to hide we're all stuff actually yeah and actually I think 
SPEAKER1 0:32:40
you'll kind of be where he can peek 
SPEAKER4 0:32:42
around the edge so it would be right 
SPEAKER2 0:32:43
about there you you MAGIC 
SPEAKER4 0:32:54
okay 
SPEAKER5 0:32:56
well you feel very hidden I feel it 
SPEAKER1 0:33:01

SPEAKER5 0:33:16
that in time if we're like 결코ě 
SPEAKER3 0:33:17
teaching distance 2 present implementation no is this humanoid but grotesque, pale-looking monstrosity of a person 
SPEAKER5 0:33:29
run out, get its head immediately cleaved off by Ord, 
SPEAKER3 0:33:33
and then the bird just comes back into the orb 
SPEAKER5 0:33:36
and kind of does the child thing where they cower around a wall, 
SPEAKER3 0:33:39
but half their body is still out in the doorway. 
SPEAKER1 0:33:42
Like, just the eyes are covered. 
SPEAKER3 0:33:44
Yep, just the eyes. That's in Sanhan. Okay, cool. I need to not have my measuring tool on constantly. This one. 10, 15, 20, 25. 
SPEAKER5 0:34:05
It's gonna move up here. 
SPEAKER3 0:34:06
You hear a second one scream as the first one did. 
SPEAKER5 0:34:11
Because it also barrels around the corner. Stops, sees its other... 
SPEAKER3 0:34:16
You don't know if it's friend? 
SPEAKER5 0:34:19
Packmate? 
SPEAKER3 0:34:20
Something? 
SPEAKER7 0:34:21
On the ground. 
SPEAKER4 0:34:23
Maybe. 
SPEAKER5 0:34:24
You never know. 
SPEAKER1 0:34:26
Maybe it was his enemy and he wants to go thank you. 
SPEAKER3 0:34:30
And it also runs up now to you, Ord. As it does, it tramples on the corpse of the previous one that had come around the corner. 
SPEAKER1 0:34:44
What did I say? 
SPEAKER3 0:34:45
At that point, because it still has its attacks, it's going to try and swing at you with this giant club. You can see now it's not actually wood. It is bone. With bits of stone put into it. 
SPEAKER5 0:35:02
I need to know. Does a 19 hit? 
SPEAKER4 0:35:05
Oh, it just does. 
SPEAKER7 0:35:07
As it tries to flatten you with that. Hold on. You can use guidance to negate that one point if there is. 
SPEAKER1 0:35:14
I can? 
SPEAKER7 0:35:15
Yeah, it's for any check. 
SPEAKER3 0:35:18
Armor class is not a check. 
SPEAKER1 0:35:21
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:35:21
I thought it was a strike check on that one. 
SPEAKER7 0:35:23
My bad. 
SPEAKER3 0:35:23
Nope. 
SPEAKER7 0:35:26
I lied. 
SPEAKER4 0:35:28
What's your armor class? 18. My shield equipped, which I equipped like five sessions ago. 
SPEAKER2 0:35:34
Never unequipped. 
SPEAKER4 0:35:36
Huh. 
SPEAKER5 0:35:38
So I'll need you to take seven bludgeoning damage and one piercing damage. 
SPEAKER1 0:35:42
Reduced. 
SPEAKER4 0:35:42
So four. 
SPEAKER3 0:35:45
Four HP. Because you are raging. 
SPEAKER2 0:35:50
Hold on. 
SPEAKER1 0:35:51
Okay, I'm good. 
SPEAKER3 0:35:54
So. 
SPEAKER1 0:35:57
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:35:59
That's going to be its turn. Fours, you are up. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:04
Um, I'm going to... Can I... Moving forward in stealth is half speed, right? 
SPEAKER6 0:36:14
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:15
Um. Okay. I'm going to move up. 
SPEAKER6 0:36:21
Um. 
SPEAKER2 0:36:22
Hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:24
Can I... Can I hide behind, like, the lip of this? I can't ping for some reason. Hold down the click button. Like, behind there? 
SPEAKER5 0:36:33
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:34
Okay. Um. So I'm going to... I can't move myself. 
SPEAKER6 0:36:38
Hmm. 
SPEAKER2 0:36:43
I can't move myself. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:45
There we go. Um. I'm going to... It won't let me move down one because I'm... 
SPEAKER2 0:36:48
Whatever. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:48
So I'm just going to, like, hide... Hide behind the rest of the wall. 
SPEAKER6 0:36:51
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:51
Um. Did I hear, like, what sounded like two of them? Or did it sound like there was more? 
SPEAKER6 0:36:58
Mm. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:59
You rolled... 
SPEAKER2 0:37:00
What did you roll up here? 
SPEAKER1 0:37:01
I rolled a 3020. 
SPEAKER3 0:37:04
From what you could tell, there were only the two. It was two sets of footsteps. 
SPEAKER1 0:37:10
All right. 
SPEAKER2 0:37:14
Um... 
SPEAKER1 0:37:14
Screw it. I'm mad. I'm going to shoot it. All right. 
SPEAKER7 0:37:20
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:37:21
In the face. Well, it doesn't really have a face, but... 
SPEAKER5 0:37:24
Oh, it does have a face. 
SPEAKER3 0:37:25
It has a very humanoid face that just seems to be missing eyes. 
SPEAKER2 0:37:32
Um... 
SPEAKER1 0:37:32
Hmm. Nope. 
SPEAKER6 0:37:39
Hmm? 
SPEAKER7 0:37:40
Oh. Oh, yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:37:42
Never mind. 
SPEAKER5 0:37:42
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:37:43
That's a 10. 
SPEAKER5 0:37:44
Yeah, no. That's not going to hit. 
SPEAKER1 0:37:46
It's not going to hit. Um. Yeah. That's what I can do because I'm... 
SPEAKER7 0:37:51
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 0:37:52
Blah, blah. 
SPEAKER2 0:37:55
All right. 
SPEAKER3 0:37:56
You take your first shot now with this new Dragon's Wrath longbow. Your first shot as a player. Your second shot in character. 
SPEAKER2 0:38:04
Um... 
SPEAKER5 0:38:05
You're a bit unaccustomed to it. It is large, and it is powerful. 
SPEAKER3 0:38:09
You're not yet used to, like, the magic enchantment as it triggers, and lightning comes down the two spokes of the... Of the... Of the bow. 
SPEAKER5 0:38:18
I'm going to call them spokes. 
SPEAKER3 0:38:19
I don't know archery terms that well. But you just barely miss. Jinun, you're up next. 
SPEAKER2 0:38:35
Um... 
SPEAKER3 0:38:36
You're seeing all of this through, like, a pigeonhole of a crack. 
SPEAKER1 0:38:40
Yeah, I was going to say, like, can I... Would that... Was I able to see any of that? 
SPEAKER5 0:38:45
You can see at least from where you are. 
SPEAKER3 0:38:48
You can see most of the situation that's going on. 
SPEAKER2 0:38:51
You just got to kind of get creative with how you're moving your head to kind of get the view. 
SPEAKER1 0:38:57
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:39:01
Um... I'm going to... I'm going to... 
SPEAKER6 0:39:19
I'm going to... 
SPEAKER1 0:39:21
I'm not going to do anything. 
SPEAKER3 0:39:22
I'm just going to sit and watch. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:24
Because at the moment, Jinun is thinking, well, or one shot the first one, 
SPEAKER7 0:39:29
looks like they got it. 
SPEAKER5 0:39:33
Okay. You passed your turn. 
SPEAKER3 0:39:35
Jizzard, what are you up to? 
SPEAKER4 0:39:36
I turned it off. Why is this still so loud? Because fuck you, that's why. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:41
I'm going to... Emboldened by... 
SPEAKER2 0:39:45
The flame of ambition? Um... 
SPEAKER4 0:39:49
Or it's heroic... Half beheading. He's going to step past the rough terrain that is Ord. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:58
And, um... 
SPEAKER4 0:40:00
Shock and grasp this bee. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:03
On the leg? 
SPEAKER4 0:40:04
How tall are these things? 
SPEAKER6 0:40:05
How tall are you? 
SPEAKER1 0:40:07
Are you like human size? 
SPEAKER4 0:40:09
I'm just at 6'3". 
SPEAKER3 0:40:10
This one is a little bit shorter than you are, actually. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:13
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:40:14
They are, in fact, human sized. 
SPEAKER4 0:40:16
I'm going to use my white-gloved right arm and just grab his neck. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:21
Noggin. Shock and grasp that, John. They're human sized, and yet they were making noises like they were giants? Eh. 
SPEAKER5 0:40:29
Well, if you pay attention to my screaming, it was more like the maddening screaming of a person 
SPEAKER3 0:40:33
who's been living in a cave for forever. 
SPEAKER5 0:40:36
So, you know. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:36
No, because when they first started, you said that they were like... 
SPEAKER3 0:40:40
Listen, chief. I made a mistake. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:43
Okay, okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:40:44
Alright? 
SPEAKER1 0:40:45
You gave us the impression that they were giants. 
SPEAKER3 0:40:47
I forgot what size they were, okay? Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:40:51
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:40:52
Shut up. 
SPEAKER1 0:40:54
This is kind of a critical thing. 
SPEAKER4 0:40:57
This one, does 24 hit? 
SPEAKER2 0:40:58
Oh, 24 does hit, yeah. How do you hit? Uh... How do you... 
SPEAKER4 0:41:05
I think that's how the attack bonus works, right? I add the 7. 
SPEAKER6 0:41:10
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 0:41:10
My attack bonus. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:11
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:41:11
It's been a method. 
SPEAKER7 0:41:13
Give that motherfucker a prostate exam. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:15
Oh. Through the head? Does Miki say that? 
SPEAKER4 0:41:20
No, this is just out of character. I do 15 lightning damage. 
SPEAKER3 0:41:27
Please describe how you fry the noggin off this thing. 
SPEAKER4 0:41:30
Uh, I grab his noggin. I electrocute his noggin with my hand. And his head explodes. To a, like a... A five-foot ring of weird monster brain. 
SPEAKER1 0:41:50
Viscerate. 
SPEAKER3 0:41:52
Gizzard, Ord, and Michi, all three of you get fucking coated in the black, rotting ichor of this creature. As you see Gizzard tiptoe over Ord, reach out with the white glove, Michael Jackson style on top of this thing's head, and then absolutely fucking fry its brain until it bursts. The rest of this creature just slumps in the space. Now in the puddle of its... Of its... Other. Uh... Of the other creature. Of its type. Ch-ch-ch-choo. Alright. From there, I'm gonna say, we are now out of... For now... We are out of... Initiative. As both have been killed. 
SPEAKER1 0:42:44
He chose to explode the creature on me? 
SPEAKER2 0:42:50
I didn't choose to explode it. 
SPEAKER4 0:42:54
It just exploded when I electrocuted its noggin. You made him boon all over us? 
SPEAKER1 0:43:00
Yep. 
SPEAKER4 0:43:00
I mean, I didn't make him do... I mean, he just did it. When I zapped his noggin. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:07
I didn't... 
SPEAKER4 0:43:11
I may have caused his head to explode, but I didn't make his head explode. 
SPEAKER2 0:43:17
I didn't make his head explode. I didn't make his head explode. Uh, the cr Evet, you got it. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:22
Let's just say that he did it, let's just tend to look for the most important thing I got are human psychology, 0 consent, bring senses over and detected emissions, pray for peace, and destroy all other falling enemies to Allah's purgatory. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:27
What you just did was oh my god. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:29
Ipressing alien minds made me feel too guilty, not only for the but uh, that's all there is. No dear, who you warmer diggin you over her, while she falls on her mão their auto applauded but still put it down with an «Le 
SPEAKER2 0:43:48
that 
SPEAKER4 0:43:48
They pull those weird aliens from Star Trek that just like glom onto your body. 
SPEAKER1 0:43:58
20, baby! 26. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:59
What you see in this space, and it's kind of dim, but you have dark vision, so you can see. There's an entire other network of caverns 
SPEAKER2 0:44:08
back behind this wall. 
SPEAKER3 0:44:12
And as you kind of notion for them to come out and join you, one of them mimics the motion back, and you get an echo into your mind. It's safe now. Kind of beckoning you in that direction. 
SPEAKER1 0:44:35
Janune interprets that as it just copying him. Yes, it's safe. You guys can come out now. 
SPEAKER2 0:44:48
What are you doing over there, Cat? 
SPEAKER1 0:44:53
I'm letting our friends know that it's safe. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:01
One of them does float back towards you. Are you going to emerge back from the area? 
SPEAKER1 0:45:06
I'll come out a little bit. Why can't I move? 
SPEAKER2 0:45:11
Oh, there we go. 
SPEAKER1 0:45:14
I'll go to the entrance right here. Get again. So I can still see them, but I can see both sides now, quite clearly. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:36
Okay. 
SPEAKER7 0:45:41
Hello. 
SPEAKER5 0:45:42
They're still here. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:44
I'm just waiting for y'all to do what y'all are going to do. 
SPEAKER2 0:45:46
Hello. 
SPEAKER7 0:45:48
I was just watching her and see where she's going. Like, where he is going. 
SPEAKER1 0:45:51
Oh, I responded. 
SPEAKER7 0:45:53
I'm sorry, what did you say? 
SPEAKER1 0:45:55
Oh, he said, I'm just letting our friends know that it's safe to come out now. Oh. Well, are they staying in there, or should we continue to follow them? Maybe... 
SPEAKER7 0:46:06
We're just trying. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:08
One of them does float out after you. 
SPEAKER7 0:46:14
To me? Or to Janune? 
SPEAKER3 0:46:16
After Janune. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:17
Janune. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:17
And another one floats out of the crevice that it had gone into near you, Michi. 
SPEAKER7 0:46:23
I want to approach it and see what they're doing. 
SPEAKER1 0:46:32
What ideas they got here. We're trying to find people. 
SPEAKER7 0:46:37
You guys? 
SPEAKER3 0:46:39
You're saying that out loud? 
SPEAKER7 0:46:41
Yes, aloud. Out loud. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:46
Out loud. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:46
Out loud. Out loud. Out loud. Out loud. 
SPEAKER7 0:46:46
Out loud. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:46
Out loud. Out loud. Out loud. Out loud. Out loud. Out loud. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:48
Out loud. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:49
Out loud. Out loud. Out loud. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:49
Out loud. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:49
Out loud. Out loud. Out loud. 
SPEAKER2 0:46:49
Out loud. Out loud. Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:50
Give me a minute, Michi. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:51
You said it's safe to come out of here? It's safe to come out of here? 
SPEAKER3 0:46:51
And then it, too, the one here, beckons to you, Michi, back into the little crevice that it came out of. And says, here, this way, it's safe here. 
SPEAKER1 0:47:06
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:47:07
I didn't say that, John. 
SPEAKER5 0:47:08
You, Jizzard, are not getting any of this. 
SPEAKER1 0:47:11
I have a question. 
SPEAKER3 0:47:12
This is telepathy. Yes. 
SPEAKER1 0:47:14
Is the one that floated back to me, alf yes okay i'm gonna reach into my actually wait no alf alf was the one that was farther in this is the other one that was that was near you can you tell them like are they are they noticeably different enough that you could tell them apart or is it just a proximity like keep your eye on the shell that's under a hat at a baseball game i want to give alf to differentiate 
SPEAKER3 0:47:41
him you can tell they're slightly different sizes there is some sort of life cycle um but none of them are like different super super look different if anything the most differentiating feature is the the kind of coloration that the disc that makes up their main body has some of them are more pale and uh um more tan some of them have more these blue striations that run across them uh some are just kind of a pale like eggshell color so there are differences but they're not very large well 
SPEAKER7 0:48:17
maybe we should take a short rest it's been a minute i agree with the rest i do disagree that this is the area to do it and i'm gonna look around and it kind of point out dead bodies on the floor covered in crap let's get the heck out of here please and follow these little dudes i have a feeling they are not here to kill us at least 
SPEAKER1 0:48:47
not yet and i'm okay with that right so but before we do that janine's gonna run over to the bodies and go loot them i ain't touching that 
SPEAKER3 0:49:00
she 
SPEAKER4 0:49:01
marty covered 
SPEAKER3 0:49:04
janine roll investigation check 
SPEAKER2 0:49:08
um um 
SPEAKER1 0:49:11
I don't want to get any more diseases from mystery monsters than any well while you're looting do keep in mind that thing was screaming so whatever might 
SPEAKER3 0:49:24
be in this cave might follow just like the last one you find four teeth of various humanoid sizes a well-hauled gut well i suppose this will be a little more interesting than the last one 
SPEAKER1 0:49:39
i suppose this will be a little more interesting than the last one so this will do for a new necklace so this will do for a new necklace 
SPEAKER3 0:49:43
the other thing you get as you notice and you look at these bodies at one point they look side of sort of some of them one of them their features are still humanoid but twisted and warped and broken and while they have a face and the face looks like it almost could be a person there are no eyes no eyelids not like the eyes removed but just like they were in a zombie's body and there's no eyes on the body they were never there. The socket's still there, but with skin that covers over them. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:16
Ew. 
SPEAKER6 0:50:16
Ew. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:19
The ears themselves 
SPEAKER3 0:50:20
have been twisted and elongated, almost like a mockery of elvish ears. And the entire 
SPEAKER2 0:50:28
body smells and reeks, 
SPEAKER3 0:50:30
almost like it's perpetually been moist. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:34
Did you get what you wanted? Well? If I can't have my dragon tooth, might as well find something new to replace it with. Very well. Well, let's get the heck out of here. 
SPEAKER7 0:50:52
These little guys see Nancy, and I am also not 
SPEAKER1 0:50:54
fond of dying. 
SPEAKER3 0:50:59
Not twice, I'd say. Okay, who's moving in what direction? 
SPEAKER7 0:51:03
I'mma follow little skibadoods. 
SPEAKER1 0:51:04
I'm gonna go in the... where was I originally going? 
SPEAKER7 0:51:08
I'm gonna go in the same 
SPEAKER6 0:51:10
direction. 
SPEAKER3 0:51:10
I'm gonna go in the same direction. 
SPEAKER6 0:51:10
I'm gonna go in there. 
SPEAKER1 0:51:12
Songhan will kinda scurry out from his orb, finally. Yeah, orb, tiny hut. Breaking it. And he'll be following Michi, like right behind her. But I guess as he passes by, he kinda takes a second to glance at the corpse, and just kinda try to observe it. 
SPEAKER3 0:51:36
It is... It has... 
SPEAKER5 0:51:40
It kinda gives the reminiscence of a caveman. 
SPEAKER3 0:51:43
It is wearing nothing but a 
SPEAKER5 0:51:45
loincloth, and you can tell the hands, 
SPEAKER3 0:51:47
each with five fingers. It is a normal hand that then leads to a long gangly forearm, and a very built upper arm. The torso itself is kind of heaved in, and the flesh sags off of the frame itself. It smells, it reeks, it's awful. The skin is this pale, grayish color. With this purple hue, of a almost skin that's never seen the sunlight, that's adapted to living just in the darkness and the shadows. The teeth are gnarled and yellowed, and grow in various different directions. Some, one of them even has like a second and third tooth behind the first, what could, what isn't really a row, but is a row of teeth. The nose is overdeveloped, and sharp, as are the ears. And while it has hair, it's scraggly and pale. And thick. Like the individual strands are thick. I also need to know, everyone's passive perception. Oh. Uh... 
SPEAKER1 0:52:52
Where do you find that? 
SPEAKER4 0:52:56
Yeah... It's just your proficiency plus, uh, wisdom. 
SPEAKER1 0:53:02
Mm-hmm. Okay... 
SPEAKER7 0:53:06
Wisdom bonus or wisdom total? 
SPEAKER3 0:53:08
Wisdom bonus. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:09
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:10
It should be in the teens. 
SPEAKER1 0:53:12
Hang on, hang on. If it's your proficiency plus your wisdom bonus, mine is a four. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:17
Yeah, it's plus your original wisdom. 
SPEAKER1 0:53:19
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:21
Yeah, no, hold on. Plus your original wisdom. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:25
Fifteen. 
SPEAKER1 0:53:27
I think mine's like six. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:29
Or... 
SPEAKER1 0:53:31
So are we going with the plus number? It should be in the teens. 
SPEAKER5 0:53:35
So it's proficiency plus the big number, 
SPEAKER3 0:53:37
under wisdom. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:39
Fifteen. Uh... 
SPEAKER1 0:53:43
So it's 18, 19. 
SPEAKER7 0:53:45
Yeah, I'm on the 19 there. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:47
So... I have... 
SPEAKER1 0:53:51
Beside my perception is a plus six with a smaller font, uh, lighter color 16, and then my wisdom has no bonus, so is it just 16? 
SPEAKER3 0:54:02
It is 16. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:03
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:04
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:05
So you don't have proficiency 
SPEAKER3 0:54:06
on your left side of your character sheet? Um... 
SPEAKER7 0:54:09
You should, Koi. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:10
You should, Koi. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:11
No, down the very middle, the middle tab, I have all of my skills. 
SPEAKER3 0:54:16
No, no, Koi. Look where your character, uh... 
SPEAKER4 0:54:19
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 0:54:20
Yeah, on the left side 
SPEAKER3 0:54:22
where your picture is. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:23
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:54:24
Oh, okay. There's proficiency plus three. 
SPEAKER7 0:54:26
Initiative and then proficiency on the right side of the box. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:28
Oh, yeah. Proficiency is plus three. 
SPEAKER7 0:54:30
So you get 19. 
SPEAKER3 0:54:31
No, three plus ten. It's 13. I thought she said 16. Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:54:38
I'm... What's your wisdom, Koi? 
SPEAKER1 0:54:40
My wisdom is ten plus zero. 
SPEAKER3 0:54:42
Proficiency is plus three. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:43
Perception is plus six with the grade out smaller font being 16. All right. So you're 13. 
SPEAKER4 0:54:47
Me and Alian are up there. 
SPEAKER3 0:54:48
Never mind. 
SPEAKER7 0:54:49
I apologize. Okay. I'm also 13. 
SPEAKER3 0:54:52
I'm also 15. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:53
You have a bunch of half stats. I think your character sheet is broken, 
SPEAKER4 0:54:55
but we'll go with 13. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:56
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:57
So, um, I'm going to go with 13. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 0:55:00
So, um, 
SPEAKER3 0:55:01
I'm going to go with 13. Okay. So, um, I'm going to go with 13. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:05
Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:07
Okay. So, with that, Michi, Janoon, and who had the 15? The additional 15? Me. 
SPEAKER5 0:55:13
I did. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:14
Michi, Janoon, Forz, and Jizzard. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:15
As the combat ends and silence comes back, 
SPEAKER3 0:55:16
you hear a voice in the distance in the same direction. Help me. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:18
That whispers out. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:19
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:26
Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:27
Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:28
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:30
Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:31
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:35
Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:36
Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER4 0:55:37
Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:38
Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER5 0:55:39
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:41
Yeah. I didn't do the voice justice because I can't really do it. Um, it, the sound's wounded and it sounds like a woman's voice. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:48
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:55:49
This is woman's voice. Wait, um, was it only, was it only Aliana and Michi who heard it? 
SPEAKER3 0:55:59
It is Aliana, Michi, Jizzard, and Forz. 
SPEAKER4 0:56:02
Where's it coming from? Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:56:04
Which direction? 
SPEAKER4 0:56:05
Here. Oh, by the blood. Which direction? 
SPEAKER1 0:56:08
I don't know. 
SPEAKER4 0:56:09
The red trail. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:10
The dried red trail. 
SPEAKER3 0:56:11
The red trail. 
SPEAKER4 0:56:12
The, the, uh. The, the, you know. 
SPEAKER2 0:56:14
Yeah, I, I, I. Influence could probably tell you it's blood because colors do have, uh, yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:16
Uh, I want to. 
SPEAKER4 0:56:17
I want to. I want to, uh, check out voice. 
SPEAKER2 0:56:19
Check out voice. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:20
Mmmm, Michi's gonna, she's gonna, grab. 
SPEAKER7 0:56:21
No? 
SPEAKER1 0:56:22
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
SPEAKER3 0:56:23
Anything that's blood that fucking much is dead. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:24
We don't know that. 
SPEAKER7 0:56:25
I mean it's making sound. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:26
It's inhuman. 
SPEAKER7 0:56:27
Help me. 
SPEAKER2 0:56:28
I, I, I. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:29
I, I, I. 
SPEAKER4 0:56:30
I'm just gonna need help myself. It's inhuman. 
SPEAKER3 0:56:34
Help me. 
SPEAKER7 0:56:37
No. 
SPEAKER4 0:56:38
I'm checking it out. 
SPEAKER7 0:56:39
You're on your own, bud. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:41
Have fun dying. 
SPEAKER4 0:56:42
Goodbye. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:45
Michi's gonna start walking the other way. 
SPEAKER7 0:56:48
Fuck that shit. 
SPEAKER1 0:56:49
Yeah, we're not dying today. You can die if you'd like, but... It doesn't even sound like what we're trying to find. We just met these cute little guys. We're looking for people. Why? Already? We're looking for two young folk, not something that sounds like an old woman. Probably a fucking hag. We're trying to... Help me. 
SPEAKER3 0:57:12
Please. 
SPEAKER4 0:57:15
Jizzard's going for it. 
SPEAKER1 0:57:17
Can I keep moving? Can I... As Janoon is following behind Michi, can you kind of look at where Jizzard's going 
SPEAKER3 0:57:25
just to try to kind of... 
SPEAKER6 0:57:26
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 0:57:27
Cautiously watch what's up. 
SPEAKER1 0:57:30
She's following Janoon. As Isanhan follows Michi, 
SPEAKER3 0:57:36
who follows Janoon, can he just glance... Look towards whatever Jizzard's going towards 
SPEAKER1 0:57:42
and try to kind of just be like... Just looking at what he's doing while they're walking away? 
SPEAKER6 0:57:49
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:57:49
Okay, yeah. I'm gonna join the huddle of people leaving suspicious. Oh! 
SPEAKER3 0:57:56
Oh! 
SPEAKER1 0:57:58
I have a question. 
SPEAKER3 0:57:59
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:02
Um... In, like, D&D and not Baldur's Gate, um... When you do Mage Hand, is Mage Hand considered its own token entity like it is in Baldur's Gate? 
SPEAKER3 0:58:21
Not really. There are no rules about that. But whether Mage Hand can... 
SPEAKER6 0:58:25
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 0:58:27
Let me look up. 
SPEAKER4 0:58:28
You just control it. 
SPEAKER3 0:58:28
You control it. 
SPEAKER6 0:58:29
You control it. 
SPEAKER3 0:58:29
I believe it can occupy the same space. 
SPEAKER4 0:58:35
I mean, it could just be, like, touching... 
SPEAKER1 0:58:36
I was curious if it would be, like, metagaming-y to, like, do what I do in Baldur's Gate. 
SPEAKER5 0:58:44
Mage Hand does not give you... As far as D&D 5e, it is a point you choose within the range, 
SPEAKER3 0:58:51
but it does not give you any awareness. You use your action to control the hand. 
SPEAKER7 0:58:57
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER2 0:58:57
Okay, okay, okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:58
Oh, you know what? 
SPEAKER5 0:59:03
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:59:06
What? I have an idea. Since the lizard is so intrigued by the hag trying to get us killed over there, uh, Janoon will pull out his, uh, cloak of many items. 
SPEAKER6 0:59:24
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 0:59:24
And he'll pull out one of... of the sets of the, uh... What is it called? 
SPEAKER3 0:59:33
The... 
SPEAKER1 0:59:35
I have it pinned for a reason. 
SPEAKER3 0:59:44
Well... 
SPEAKER1 0:59:46
I have two sets of mastiffs. I'm gonna pull out one set of the two mastiffs. I'm sorry, like the dogs? 
SPEAKER7 0:59:54
Yes. 
SPEAKER4 0:59:55
A set of dogs. 
SPEAKER1 0:59:57
Yeah. Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:59:58
What constitutes a set of dogs? 
SPEAKER1 1:00:00
Like, like, four dogs, but they only come in pairs. Yeah, for some reason they come in pairs. But... Unless we're talking about sled teams, but that's not gonna happen with mastiffs. They don't like that sort of thing. Anyways. 
SPEAKER5 1:00:14
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 1:00:15
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 1:00:17
Pull out one of the patches. And out come two mastiffs. Two mastiff dogs. 
SPEAKER3 1:00:27
Okay. All right. Okay. Um... 
SPEAKER1 1:00:38
Where the fuck do these come from? Did you not just watch me pull it out of the cloak? 
SPEAKER7 1:00:48
Nope. I was playing Mr. Squishy. 
SPEAKER1 1:00:54
I'm magic. I was following you the whole time. I'm actually a level 10 wizard. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:01
I'm actually a level 10 wizard. 
SPEAKER7 1:01:02
Who are you and what is a level? What is a level? 
SPEAKER1 1:01:04
What is a level? 
SPEAKER2 1:01:05
Wait, you guys are level 10? 
SPEAKER1 1:01:06
No. You guys, none of your characters know what the concept of a level is. 
SPEAKER4 1:01:08
No, maybe it's like a level of a rank. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:09
No, I don't know if this world does or not. 
SPEAKER5 1:01:10
This one does not. Sorry. No. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:13
This one does not. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:14
I mean, like a level of a hierarchy of wizards. Just to double check, since I was gone. We're not level 10, right? We're not level 10. We're not level 10. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:19
We're not level ram. 
SPEAKER7 1:01:20
We're not level 10. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:21
We're not level 10. We're not level 10. 
SPEAKER4 1:01:23
We're not level 10. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:24
No. No. Okay. Okay. Wait, you guys get paid? 
SPEAKER3 1:01:29
Fuck. 
SPEAKER4 1:01:30
Wait, you guys get levels? 
SPEAKER3 1:01:31
Are we doing it with these dogs? 
SPEAKER1 1:01:32
I hate it. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:33
So yes, the rest of you watch as Janune rips a patch off of her cloak and it apparates this pair of giant dogs. Not actually giant, but these large dogs. 
SPEAKER1 1:01:53
I'm gonna grab my daggers and like brace myself. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:58
I have an idea. 
SPEAKER7 1:02:01
And Michi is gonna hold the owlbear plushie that she stole from her bag. 
SPEAKER1 1:02:14
We could use this to find them instead of just being fucking absolutely obtuse and going into a fucking blood-coated area. You got a good idea there, I think. Yes, that was your idea. I think. Yes, that was your idea. 
SPEAKER4 1:02:26
I'd be entirely certain that they are friendly and can crack. 
SPEAKER1 1:02:31
I would not have them otherwise. 
SPEAKER2 1:02:34
All right. 
SPEAKER1 1:02:35
Janune is going to crouch down and look at the two masters that are just sitting there obediently kind of panting and he'll pat them on the head. What do you say, little fellas? 
SPEAKER3 1:02:51
Do you have- 
SPEAKER1 1:02:52
Do you have- Do you have a guarantee that this is going to work? Because every time someone else has done magic, it fails. Oh. It's not magic, they're just dogs. 
SPEAKER4 1:02:57
Yes, because you can put a dog in your pocket and make it appear. 
SPEAKER3 1:02:58
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 1:02:59
Uh. For you, force. You were just in Michi's pocket. She's got a point, but either way, I did cast magic and I have not exploded or turned into a cretin, so we're good. I'm glad you're happy. 
SPEAKER3 1:03:07
I'm glad you're happy. 
SPEAKER4 1:03:08
I'm glad you're happy. 
SPEAKER7 1:03:09
I'm glad you're happy. 
SPEAKER1 1:03:10
I'm glad you're happy. I'm glad you're happy. 
SPEAKER3 1:03:12
I'm glad you're happy. I'm glad you're happy. I'm glad you're happy. 
SPEAKER7 1:03:15
I'm glad you're happy. 
SPEAKER1 1:03:16
I'm glad you're happy. 
SPEAKER7 1:03:23
I'm going to crouch down and put the owlbear plushie close to the dog's face. Find me, boy. Find me, boy. 
SPEAKER3 1:03:32
For... 
SPEAKER1 1:03:33
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 1:03:34
For... 
SPEAKER1 1:03:35
I was going to have them explore the area. Explore the spot over there, but that works too. Oh, if you want to do that, then go for it. Oh, no, no, that actually works better. 
SPEAKER7 1:03:39
That works better. 
SPEAKER1 1:03:40
That's perfect. I didn't even know you had dogs. I just wanted to steal a plushie. What? 
SPEAKER3 1:03:44
Is that the case? 
SPEAKER7 1:03:45
I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 1:03:46
I don't know. 
SPEAKER2 1:03:47
I don't know. 
SPEAKER7 1:03:48
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 1:03:51
I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 1:03:52
I don't know. Oh, the kids' plushie? 
SPEAKER7 1:03:54
Yeah, it's the little girl's. 
SPEAKER4 1:03:56
The one that's covered in, like, weird... 
SPEAKER3 1:03:59
No, that was the other one. 
SPEAKER7 1:04:01
The one you licked was the one that was in plasma. 
SPEAKER3 1:04:02
So I don't know if that's the one you licked. 
SPEAKER2 1:04:03
The one that's in plasma. 
SPEAKER1 1:04:04
I don't know. 
SPEAKER2 1:04:05
I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 1:04:06
I don't know. I don't know. Thank you. No, thank you. Sorry, for more clarification, because I assumed Junina was not there when that happened. Whose plush is that? 
SPEAKER7 1:04:17
That is the daughter's, from the investigation that Chizard has started. 
SPEAKER1 1:04:22
Oh. See, I was just gonna send them down that, that, uh, that trap, and if they didn't return, I was just gonna assume that it was a trap after all, but, but I like your idea a lot better. Why would you do that? You're gonna kill them? Well, a lot better than, than, than the lizard, right? Or, or did we want to sacrifice the lizard? I'm fine either way. 
SPEAKER7 1:04:45
I mean, he does what he wants. If he wants to die on his own, that's, that's his prerogative, but we made a promise to help find these kids, and I plan to stick to doing that. In tact, by the way. So, so, if we can carry on, if you want to send them out, that's your choice. They're your dogs, but... 
SPEAKER1 1:05:08
I like your idea better. 
SPEAKER4 1:05:09
What would, what would you do with two massive dogs? 
SPEAKER3 1:05:14
Uh, uh... 
SPEAKER1 1:05:15
Go ahead, boys. Sniff. 
SPEAKER7 1:05:19
Michi's gonna bark in with haste, please. 
SPEAKER3 1:05:21
Okay, I have a question for the player, for, for Aliana as a player. In your actor, can you control, you should have one that says Mastiff, right? 
SPEAKER7 1:05:31
Yes. 
SPEAKER5 1:05:31
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 1:05:32
Okay, you should now be able to place and control your Mastiff tokens. 
SPEAKER1 1:05:37
That's so cute. 
SPEAKER3 1:05:39
So, place them where you need to be, and then in-game, we'll handle what you guys are doing, and then we'll handle what Jizzard is doing. 
SPEAKER1 1:05:45
I don't know how to place it. 
SPEAKER3 1:05:47
Just drag and drop. 
SPEAKER7 1:05:48
One. 
SPEAKER3 1:05:50
Two. 
SPEAKER7 1:05:51
There you go. 
SPEAKER2 1:05:53
Yay! Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 1:05:56
So, back in character, the two great hounds both take very long sniffs at this, very long, very rapid sniffs at this plushie as you bring it out. Just all over it. And, one sec. I gotta kill a bug. Hold on. Scatter. 
SPEAKER7 1:06:20
Roaches. 
SPEAKER3 1:06:20
Roaches. Nope. It's a cricket? 
SPEAKER5 1:06:22
It's a cricket. 
SPEAKER3 1:06:23
It's a cricket. 
SPEAKER7 1:06:24
The fuck? 
SPEAKER5 1:06:24
It fell. 
SPEAKER3 1:06:24
I haven't even tried to hit it yet. 
SPEAKER5 1:06:26
Where are you, bitch? 
SPEAKER3 1:06:30
That's very rude. That is rude. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:32
That is rude. 
SPEAKER3 1:06:34
Cricket did nothing wrong. It didn't pay rent, alright? 
SPEAKER1 1:06:36
Of course it did. 
SPEAKER7 1:06:38
Of course it did. 
SPEAKER3 1:06:38
What? 
SPEAKER7 1:06:40
It eats the mulch in your house. 
SPEAKER2 1:06:42
It eats the mulch in your house. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:45
Better a cricket than a spider. 
SPEAKER3 1:06:49
Yes, but like... 
SPEAKER7 1:06:50
Also, Chinese say good luck, and you're killing good luck. May your rolls be shitty from there on forward. 
SPEAKER3 1:07:00
It would be very good for you for my rolls to be shitty, just saying. Okay. 
SPEAKER7 1:07:09
There's a cricket in the game, and now we hear it echoing in the distance. 
SPEAKER3 1:07:12
Okay, cool, cool, cool. Hehehe. 
SPEAKER5 1:07:14
Where was I before I was rudely interrupted? 
SPEAKER3 1:07:18
Um, yeah, so the two mastiffs, both of them, they rapidly sniff at this plushie as it's presented to them. And then, in unison, they begin to sniff around the cavern itself. Right? Passing Gizzard, passing the area and all the corpses. 
SPEAKER5 1:07:34
They... 
SPEAKER3 1:07:35
After the first initial smell, you hear the... I don't know what it's called. With a big exhale, they really do not like the smell of the creatures you've killed so far. Nor do they enjoy the smell of the flumps. As they do, one of them goes up and smells the flumps, though. The floating creature that is near you, Jinoon. 
SPEAKER2 1:07:53
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 1:07:55
And then stares at it for a little bit. The other one, as it moves around the area, eventually begins to move and point in the same area Gizzard is going. The second one that is now staring at the flump eventually... Looks to you and then looks towards the crevice of the cavern. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:17
Hmm. The crevice to the right? Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 1:08:20
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:21
The flump that is... 
SPEAKER3 1:08:22
Or the floating pancake thing... 
SPEAKER1 1:08:23
I should use the name you guys know, which is floating pancake thing. Looks to you and you hear... 
SPEAKER3 1:08:25
Oh, it's Jinoon. 
SPEAKER7 1:08:26
Jinoon. 
SPEAKER3 1:08:27
Jinoon. Jinoon. Jinoon. Jinoon. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:31
Jinoon. 
SPEAKER3 1:08:32
Jinoon. Jinoon. Jinoon. Jinoon. Jinoon. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:37
Jinoon. Jinoon. 
SPEAKER3 1:08:39
Jinoon. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:40
Jinoon. 
SPEAKER3 1:08:41
Jinoon. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:42
Jinoon. Jinoon. Jinoon. 
SPEAKER3 1:08:45
Jinoon. Jinoon. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:47
That's what's going on there. Follow, friend and be safe. That's what's going on there. Gizzard and Ord, what are you guys up to? March around the corner with this puppy. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 1:08:53
I had done this cabin before. Well, I don't know around of course, but I know Gizzard's round off on his own and 
SPEAKER4 1:08:59
I don't like that. Gizzard, as you round the corner, you have to do this. I'm not sure how you're going to do this though. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think you're going to be able to do this. 
SPEAKER2 1:09:09
That is the way it is. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:09:11
All right. corner, the trail of what is definitely now dried blood gets more evident and thicker as it loops around and back up another wall to another crevice in the rock. 
SPEAKER1 1:09:25
Oh, oh. Oh. 
SPEAKER4 1:09:29
I see something. I see something. 
SPEAKER3 1:09:32
As you move up, you see in the distance the body of a young woman on the floor, bleeding from the torso. 
SPEAKER1 1:09:39
No! 
SPEAKER4 1:09:40
Please! 
SPEAKER2 1:09:42
Dorm over. 
SPEAKER1 1:09:46
As you dorm over... 
SPEAKER2 1:09:47
I'm gonna show 
SPEAKER3 1:09:49
there's a body. 
SPEAKER4 1:09:51
There's a girl over here. 
SPEAKER3 1:09:56
As you get close, I need you to make an insight check. 
SPEAKER4 1:10:00
Insight? 
SPEAKER3 1:10:02
Insight or perception? 
SPEAKER4 1:10:06
20. 
SPEAKER3 1:10:08
20. You get up close and you look at this girl and you're like, and as you kneel down, something's not right. The arms don't bend that way. The blood isn't uniform. It's wet, but not. And then as you look at the face, the facial features are nondescript. You can see from the distance what looks like a mouth, but it's just kind of a line. What looked like eyes, but are just voids. What looks like facial hair and features and a nose, but it's just solid flesh. Ord, I need you to also roll a perception check. See what you see. 
SPEAKER4 1:10:50
Perception or insight? 
SPEAKER3 1:10:51
Perception. Just perception. 
SPEAKER4 1:10:54
Okay, perception. 
SPEAKER1 1:10:56
I need to know what kind of rikidiki shit you're watching to come up with this. 
SPEAKER3 1:11:03
Ord, as you watch Gizzard kneel down and then kind of recoil a bit, 
SPEAKER7 1:11:07
what you also see is from the back 
SPEAKER3 1:11:09
the corpse itself kind of lifts as four pseudopods reach out from behind. 
SPEAKER5 1:11:14
And I'm going to need both of you to roll initiative! 
SPEAKER1 1:11:17
Yeah. What do you mean by pseudopod? Like, the same as the pancakes? 
SPEAKER5 1:11:26
No. Well, yes. Kind of the same, but purple and larger. 
SPEAKER3 1:11:30
As that and a small box that was what she was pointing at on the other ground also begins to move and split. And the torso of this woman that was bloody earlier opens to see teeth on either edge as a giant maw forms in the middle of this body. 
SPEAKER1 1:11:47
Ew. Oh, no. 
SPEAKER3 1:11:49
Chup, chup, and chup. 
SPEAKER4 1:11:57
Screw you. 
SPEAKER3 1:12:00
So, 
SPEAKER2 1:12:00
with that, 
SPEAKER5 1:12:03
combat's going to start. Yoink. Gizzard, what are you going to do? 
SPEAKER2 1:12:11
Um... 
SPEAKER3 1:12:12
This body is not a humanoid body. It might not even be a body. 
SPEAKER4 1:12:18
Fuck. 
SPEAKER2 1:12:19
Um... It's a fucking playman from Spy Kids. 
SPEAKER4 1:12:24
Ah, shit. Gizzard's going to panic and cast mirror image. 
SPEAKER2 1:12:31
Or not mirror image. 
SPEAKER4 1:12:33
Yeah, mirror image. That's the one. 
SPEAKER1 1:12:35
Panic so much he doesn't know what to cast. Mirror image. 
SPEAKER6 1:12:39
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 1:12:41
Like, three things I could cast, 
SPEAKER1 1:12:42
but I would be in trouble 
SPEAKER4 1:12:44
no matter what I cast. Mirror image is the best bet. 
SPEAKER6 1:12:48
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER5 1:12:51
Okay, so you cast mirror image. It gives you how many copies that are fake? 
SPEAKER1 1:12:55
Three? 
SPEAKER4 1:12:57
I think three. 
SPEAKER5 1:12:59
Okay, cool. 
SPEAKER7 1:13:00
Um, 
SPEAKER5 1:13:01
I don't have a way of denoting 
SPEAKER3 1:13:02
where those mirrors are, 
SPEAKER5 1:13:04
but there are now three of you in that space. 
SPEAKER2 1:13:07
Because they all kind of occupy the same space. 
SPEAKER3 1:13:09
Is there anything else you're going to do on your turn? 
SPEAKER2 1:13:11
I don't know. 
SPEAKER4 1:13:12
You still have movement. Okay, I'll take a step back. I'm too busy being a shock to do more than a step back. 
SPEAKER5 1:13:23
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:13:24
Ord, you're up. 
SPEAKER2 1:13:27
Yeah, Ord's, uh... 
SPEAKER4 1:13:31
Ord's going to shout back at the group. Oh, that's not a girl. And, uh... 
SPEAKER2 1:13:39
Oh. Oh. 
SPEAKER6 1:13:41
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 1:13:41
Get all... 
SPEAKER4 1:13:42
Look, and I can move through. This is, like, a different dimension, right? Which is just rough terrain. That would just be... 
SPEAKER3 1:13:51
Yes, to move past him would be rough terrain here. 
SPEAKER1 1:13:55
What did we tell you? 
SPEAKER2 1:13:59
This, this calls... 
SPEAKER4 1:14:01
This sounds like a raging, stabbing 
SPEAKER2 1:14:03
kindờ situation. 
SPEAKER4 1:14:05
I'm good at those. 
SPEAKER2 1:14:09
So... 
SPEAKER1 1:14:09
If Orc gets two... 
SPEAKER4 1:14:11
Is it two attacks or two turns per turn? 
SPEAKER2 1:14:15
Two attacks. 
SPEAKER4 1:14:17
Well I can only get one attack but then I have another ability that gives me bonus attack. 
SPEAKER2 1:14:23
Does a 15 hit? 
SPEAKER3 1:14:26
A 15 does. 
SPEAKER4 1:14:33
Oh and this can be a 14. No a 16. 
SPEAKER2 1:14:36
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:14:38
Okay. Okay. Did you do 16 damage? Which one are you attacking? 
SPEAKER2 1:15:02
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:15:05
Cool. You sink your axe into it and you feel like you've almost sliced this girl in half or whatever was in this girl. But it keeps moving. It keeps writhing. The body itself is now split into two and then continues to split and change forms. 
SPEAKER2 1:15:26
What is it changing into? 
SPEAKER3 1:15:28
Can't tell. 
SPEAKER2 1:15:29
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:15:30
Anything else in your turn? 
SPEAKER4 1:15:32
I'm going to attack to slice up one of the bits that's still wriggling. 
SPEAKER2 1:15:37
Okay. Does a 20 hit? 
SPEAKER5 1:15:45
A 20 does hit. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 1:15:52
10. Okay. You hit it again. Now it screeches. It gurgles and this purple blood spouts out from where you've hit it. 
SPEAKER5 1:16:09
It's not looking great. 
SPEAKER2 1:16:11
And you can tell that whatever it is now across the torso on the arms there are all these small eyes that are now opening up. 
SPEAKER3 1:16:18
Multiples of them. 
SPEAKER4 1:16:20
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:16:22
Question. 
SPEAKER3 1:16:25
Yes. It's once within 30 feet. It's just right around the corner of me. Yes. You do not have line of sight. Okay. I will check but I do not believe you have line of sight. 
SPEAKER7 1:16:35
I don't think I need line of sight necessarily but I'll check that while you do this. 
SPEAKER3 1:16:41
Okay. Cool. Lord, if that's the end of your turn. 
SPEAKER2 1:16:44
Cool. Oh yeah. I can't. I haven't seen it. 
SPEAKER3 1:16:49
The creature behind you, the one that was imitating what you now figure was some form of backpack or other pack that this woman was made to be holding, its pseudopods now reach out. And it is going to go ahead and use a pseudopod attack on Jizzard. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:10
Pseudopod attack? 
SPEAKER4 1:17:12
Is it like farting at me? What's it doing? 
SPEAKER3 1:17:15
No. It swings this giant fleshy bat almost like a pseudopod is kind of like a balled up tentacle. 
SPEAKER4 1:17:23
Ah. Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:25
Um. 
SPEAKER3 1:17:27
That's. Okay. Cool. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:31
Okay. Cool. Okay. Cool. Hold on. 
SPEAKER3 1:17:35
That's not the. Oh. Pseudopod. Here we go. Plus five. Does a 20 hit? 
SPEAKER4 1:17:44
Oh yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:17:45
Yeah. Cool. 
SPEAKER3 1:17:47
Um. I'm going to need you to take 10 points of bludgeon damage. Yep. 10 points of bludgeon damage and you are grappled. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:57
Wait. Wait. What happened to my health? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. 
SPEAKER4 1:18:08
You take damage last session for Rokrit? Yeah. But it was a 21 earlier and then I didn't get attacked at all and it went down to 17. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:17
Uh. Did it already apply the 10 damage? 
SPEAKER4 1:18:20
I did now. 
SPEAKER1 1:18:22
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:18:23
But like they went down four points at some point. 
SPEAKER2 1:18:26
Red. Red. 
SPEAKER5 1:18:29
Well. Update so your everything is accurate. 
SPEAKER2 1:18:31
And then we'll continue. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:33
But yes. You are now grappled. 
SPEAKER2 1:18:36
Okay. Got it. Gotcha. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:18:43
Cool. Just. 
SPEAKER2 1:18:45
Just. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:46
As across it and across the various where the zipper would be on a normal bag it opens and also reveals this toothy maw that tries that immediately opens and adjusts to be your size. The bag itself swells up and you can see eyes across the ridges on it open and begin to lock onto you with a burning glowing pupil. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:08
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:11
That's its turn. Now the next one. 
SPEAKER5 1:19:13
The next one is going to go ahead and do the same on you Ord. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:18
It is also going to try and hit you with one of the pseudopods. Does a 21 hit? 
SPEAKER2 1:19:25
Just a little bit. A little bit. Cool. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:29
Cool. Cool. I'm going to need to take nine bludgeoning damage reduced to four for rage. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:35
And you are also grappled. That is rough buddy. 
SPEAKER6 1:19:40
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:41
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:44
That'll be its turn. 
SPEAKER5 1:19:46
At the top of the round. Everyone else. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:48
What are you doing? 
SPEAKER4 1:19:52
Isonghan is kind of scurrying. Kind of behind Forrest. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:58
Kind of like, oops, wait, I couldn't put it. 
SPEAKER1 1:20:02
Well. 
SPEAKER4 1:20:03
I'm trying to stay away from sight of whatever the fuck is going on where they are. 
SPEAKER1 1:20:09
Can we, we can hear like noise. 
SPEAKER6 1:20:12
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER7 1:20:13
Meechee's going to. 
SPEAKER1 1:20:14
Meechee's just standing there like I fucking told them. I know exactly. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:19
What did we learn boys? 
SPEAKER1 1:20:22
I'm not going up there. 
SPEAKER7 1:20:24
Meechee is shouting out to the fucking two that ran off on their own. Ha ha. 
SPEAKER2 1:20:28
No response. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:29
They must not have learned. 
SPEAKER1 1:20:30
Is like, is the combat noises are they like, does it sound like they're fighting and like 
SPEAKER3 1:20:31
have a good chance or does it sound like they're like absolutely getting walloped and like 
SPEAKER1 1:20:32
one of them could be dead at this point? Make a perception check. 
SPEAKER2 1:20:34
I am also good at all this. I have a perception that's notably one of my high skills. 
SPEAKER1 1:20:37
Parting. What was it? I will. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. 
SPEAKER5 1:20:47
I am. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:48
I am. 
SPEAKER1 1:20:49
I am. 
SPEAKER4 1:20:50
I am. 
SPEAKER2 1:20:51
I am. 
SPEAKER1 1:20:52
I am. I am. I am. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:55
I am. 
SPEAKER5 1:20:56
What was the- 
SPEAKER3 1:20:56
Hi, I'm Lola. 
SPEAKER5 1:21:01
Um, you haven't heard any sounds that sound like death throes yet. They also haven't- didn't respond to what Michi shouted, so. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:08
Uh, what you do realize, Janine- 
SPEAKER1 1:21:10
Is that a question? 
SPEAKER5 1:21:10
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:12
I didn't hear it. 
SPEAKER4 1:21:12
I didn't hear that. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:14
You didn't hear me say, what did we learn? 
SPEAKER4 1:21:17
Oh, I thought you were talking to everyone else. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:19
No, I was talking to the two that ran off on their own. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:22
What did we learn, boys? 
SPEAKER7 1:21:26
I guess they're alright. 
SPEAKER2 1:21:30
Shall we carry on? 
SPEAKER3 1:21:31
Janine, you do notice that your mastiff that was now pointing in the direction is kind of looking off here. Um, and is growling. 
SPEAKER2 1:21:39
Oh, fucking hell. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:41
Give me a sec. 
SPEAKER5 1:21:44
Poised, tail up, and growling. Ears pivoted backwards. 
SPEAKER1 1:21:50
What minute? Is it saying that that's what we're looking at? Or is it growling because that thing is clearly fat? I think what we're hearing is possibly them fighting something, but they're capable to walk off on their own. 
SPEAKER2 1:22:06
I'm sure they're capable of killing it on their own, yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:09
Does anyone know how to talk to animals? Uh, I can give it a shot, though I don't speak animal. 
SPEAKER7 1:22:18
And Michi's gonna jokingly bark at the dog. 
SPEAKER5 1:22:21
Dog. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:24
Dog. 
SPEAKER6 1:22:24
Dog. Dog. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:24
Dog. 
SPEAKER6 1:22:24
Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:25
Dog. 
SPEAKER6 1:22:25
Dog. Dog. 
SPEAKER5 1:22:25
Dog. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:26
Dog. 
SPEAKER6 1:22:26
Dog. Dog. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:30
Dog. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:36
Dog. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:37
Dog. Dog. Dog. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:51
Dog. Dog. 
SPEAKER1 1:22:54
Dog. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:55
Adding to the chaos 
SPEAKER1 1:22:57
This is a serious fucking matter What do you mean? Do you speak animal? Perhaps we should keep our voices down So that we don't cause any more problems 
SPEAKER2 1:23:07
You're right 
SPEAKER1 1:23:07
We're trying to figure out if he's Growling on the creature because That creature, that thing Is the little girl that we're looking for Mangled And And clearly not herself anymore You think a dog is going to Growl at a child I don't trust the magic dog Did you not see that thing You were fighting earlier Like There's things There's things Possessing people It's possible that it Possessed the little girl So if the dog is growling at It and it's the little girl There's no need to go forward Because the girl Is right here 
SPEAKER2 1:23:54
But then those two should definitely 
SPEAKER7 1:23:57
Be able to handle this and have it resolved 
SPEAKER3 1:23:59
By now, yes I don't know 
SPEAKER1 1:24:03
That's why I'm trying to have someone Who can speak with animals Try and communicate With my voice Michi is just going to make kind of what 
SPEAKER7 1:24:13
Seems to be a joking gesture 
SPEAKER3 1:24:15
Of animal speak but it's actually What's going on 
SPEAKER2 1:24:18
Okay 
SPEAKER3 1:24:23
Well 
SPEAKER5 1:24:24
Okay are you using animal speak now 
SPEAKER7 1:24:27
Yes it is just It sounds like playful barking just at her again To annoy Janoon But it's actually a question 
SPEAKER3 1:24:34
Okay So you bark out at this dog now In a more communicable sense And as it barks back what you hear is 
SPEAKER2 1:24:43
Um 
SPEAKER3 1:24:45
Something is attacking 
SPEAKER2 1:24:49
Oh 
SPEAKER3 1:24:51
Well 
SPEAKER7 1:24:53
There you have it 
SPEAKER1 1:24:54
They're fighting something They're fine 
SPEAKER7 1:24:56
And Michi's going to kind of Raise her brow looking at the dog Questionably 
SPEAKER5 1:25:02
The dogs would know who you would be like confused It doesn't know what this is 
SPEAKER1 1:25:06
I just want to make sure It wasn't the people we were searching for Okay I don't care if the lizard Dies okay He did it to himself 
SPEAKER7 1:25:17
Then I think he's done it to himself 
SPEAKER3 1:25:21
And with that We'll hit the top of the combat turn 
SPEAKER2 1:25:24
Okay 
SPEAKER5 1:25:25
Jizzard you're up 
SPEAKER3 1:25:27
You are grappled 
SPEAKER4 1:25:28
I'm going to grab this tentacle 
SPEAKER2 1:25:30
Give it the old Shot to it With the 
SPEAKER1 1:25:36
Shot some crabs 
SPEAKER2 1:25:38
One thing 
SPEAKER5 1:25:41
When I hit you with that You already had mirror image up I'd need it to roll at disadvantage right 
SPEAKER1 1:25:45
Oh Uh 
SPEAKER4 1:25:47
What was the roll to like actually grapple it Because it has to be above a certain 
SPEAKER1 1:25:52
Um 
SPEAKER6 1:25:52
Okay Um Uh Uh 
SPEAKER2 1:25:52
Uh 
SPEAKER6 1:25:52
Uh Uh Uh Uh Ah 
SPEAKER3 1:25:53
Well no, for me to hit you with Mirror Image, I need to roll at disadvantage, correct? 
SPEAKER4 1:26:00
Uh, no, you have to roll, and the armor class of my thing is different depending on how many there are left. 
SPEAKER3 1:26:09
Okay, well I rolled a 21. 
SPEAKER4 1:26:12
Okay, that would definitely hit more than one. 
SPEAKER1 1:26:14
I think it would actually grapple me, but it would just miss. 
SPEAKER2 1:26:19
Hold on. 
SPEAKER3 1:26:26
The way Gizzard's being re-grapped, I'm the idiot. No, I'm checking the rules on something, because he casted Mirror Image as a spell before everything went down. 
SPEAKER5 1:26:37
Gizzard, we need to know if you- how you- you need to know how your spells work! 
SPEAKER4 1:26:47
Oh, I could alter the- Direction of the attack. I'm just gonna take it and assume that it hit me, because I don't want to have to figure this out in post. 
SPEAKER3 1:26:54
Cool, alright. 
SPEAKER5 1:26:55
It hit me. 
SPEAKER3 1:26:57
Alright, so you're grappled. What are you doing? Hitting it with that, uh, shock tool? Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 1:27:02
So I roll, uh, like, um... Okay, roll a B12. Oh. 
SPEAKER6 1:27:12
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 1:27:13
Nice. So as you go to, like, hit it, you realize that every part of your body that is- that gets hit by this thing just immediately adheres to it. And your hand dissipates electricity against the wall, as your arm is now just stuck to the side of the pseudopod. 
SPEAKER2 1:27:31
Shit. 
SPEAKER7 1:27:33
Cool. Gizzard's screaming out, now, shit. 
SPEAKER3 1:27:37
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 1:27:38
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 1:27:39
Ha ha! 
SPEAKER7 1:27:40
I guess he has found some scat to play with this time. 
SPEAKER2 1:27:43
I guess he has found some scat to play with this time. 
SPEAKER3 1:27:44
Anything else on your turn, Gizzard? 
SPEAKER4 1:27:48
No. 
SPEAKER1 1:27:49
No. 
SPEAKER5 1:27:50
Okay, cool. Ord, you're up. 
SPEAKER1 1:27:52
I'm gonna begin the attunement process. 
SPEAKER4 1:27:54
Okay, yeah, we're just gonna, like, take a slice at the little thing that's wrapped around him. That's what this is. 
SPEAKER3 1:28:03
Um... 
SPEAKER4 1:28:05
D-d-d-d-no. 
SPEAKER2 1:28:08
Ooh, okay. It's off. It's 14 now. 14 does. Oh, my god... 
SPEAKER4 1:28:23
Oh, wait, no. 
SPEAKER2 1:28:24
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Bro... No, no. 
SPEAKER4 1:28:30
Okay, 10 damage. 
SPEAKER2 1:28:35
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:28:37
Now this one looks bloody and fucking beat. And you can tell that it's trying to keep the form of the body together. It's... It's what really is this kind of amorphous purple ooze type deal. It's more structurally sound than the oozes you fought before. It's not translucent. It doesn't have any sort of shape to it. But you can tell that it's still trying to keep a humanoid form, at least now. Covered in its own ichor and blood. 
SPEAKER1 1:29:07
Gotcha. 
SPEAKER4 1:29:08
Is it still grappling you? It is still grappling you. 
SPEAKER2 1:29:11
Okay, now I'm going to hit that bitch again. 
SPEAKER5 1:29:20
We'll hit. 
SPEAKER3 1:29:26
Jesus Christ. 
SPEAKER4 1:29:29
You're taking all my rolls. 
SPEAKER3 1:29:32
You keep sinking your axe into it. At this point, you're just kind of chopping it into segments. As different parts of its construction just slough off. Onto the ground. Like just raw meat that's been cleaved off and leaks blood out of it. 
SPEAKER1 1:29:47
Mimic Sushi. Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 1:29:51
I'll come back to you. 
SPEAKER3 1:29:52
Okay. Dungeon Mace you out here. 
SPEAKER1 1:29:54
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:29:55
Alright. 
SPEAKER3 1:29:57
Anything next? 
SPEAKER4 1:30:00
Um, if I can. 
SPEAKER3 1:30:02
Yep, you used your action. You don't got a movement. 
SPEAKER2 1:30:05
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:30:07
Alright. Bring us the first one's turn. 
SPEAKER2 1:30:11
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:30:12
So, um, this one that has you grappled, El Jizzard. It's going to try and wheel you in for a bite bite attack as it reels you into the bag and the bag kind of cartoonishly expands to try and wrap around your upper torso. 
SPEAKER4 1:30:27
But can I have it try and attack it? 
SPEAKER2 1:30:31
Do, do. 
SPEAKER3 1:30:32
Sure. 
SPEAKER2 1:30:33
What's the? What's the? What's the? 
SPEAKER1 1:30:36
What's the? 
SPEAKER2 1:30:37
What's the? 
SPEAKER4 1:30:38
What's the? 
SPEAKER2 1:30:39
What's the? What's the? What's the? 
SPEAKER1 1:30:41
What's the? 
SPEAKER6 1:30:41
What's the? 
SPEAKER1 1:30:41
What's the? 
SPEAKER2 1:30:42
What's the attack? 
SPEAKER3 1:30:43
Uh, it's an 18. Uh, does something damage me if it hits my armor class? 
SPEAKER4 1:30:49
Exactly. 
SPEAKER1 1:30:50
Size 19 armor class. 
SPEAKER2 1:30:51
It does not. 
SPEAKER4 1:30:52
It's defeated. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 1:30:54
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:30:55
I'll take it then. 
SPEAKER4 1:30:56
I'll just tank that. 
SPEAKER2 1:30:57
I don't know. 
SPEAKER4 1:30:58
So one thing, you won't know whether it will hit you or not until after it hits you. 
SPEAKER3 1:31:03
So you kind of have to make the decision of whether you want to have your armor class or not. Okay. Okay. You kind of want to need to make the decision as a character of whether you're going to try and have an illusion take it before the actual hit attack hits. 
SPEAKER4 1:31:18
Change the attack's target to duplicate. Oh. Okay. So I have to decide that ahead of time. I definitely would have had one if I can. 
SPEAKER2 1:31:30
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:31:31
Unless I roll shit. 
SPEAKER4 1:31:32
Wait, wait, wait. I have to actually roll. 
SPEAKER3 1:31:34
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:31:35
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 1:31:36
Well, I heard it's one of my boys. 
SPEAKER3 1:31:39
Okay. And what's their armor class? 
SPEAKER2 1:31:42
Shit, shit. 
SPEAKER4 1:31:43
I don't know. 
SPEAKER2 1:31:44
Definitely not above mine. 
SPEAKER4 1:31:45
So definitely would have hit you. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:31:47
One of your duplicates is destroyed as it chomps down and one of the images shatters into fractal spell pieces before fading out of existence. 
SPEAKER4 1:31:59
You all hear that from Gizzard as well. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:05
Sounds like they're doing fine. Sounds like they're doing fine. 
SPEAKER7 1:32:08
Okay. I'm not worried. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:10
And then the next one's turn. Next one is going to try and use a bite attack on you, Ord. Nice. 
SPEAKER3 1:32:13
Does a 19 hit? 
SPEAKER2 1:32:14
Not nice. Does the Ord have the same armor class? That's great. 
SPEAKER5 1:32:17
Wait a minute. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:18
No. 
SPEAKER5 1:32:19
Does an 11 hit? 
SPEAKER2 1:32:20
Sorry. No. No. No. 
SPEAKER3 1:32:24
No. No. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:26
No. No. No. No. 
SPEAKER4 1:32:30

SPEAKER2 1:32:32

SPEAKER3 1:32:37
No. No. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:39
No. 
SPEAKER3 1:32:40
No. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:41
No. The way it does its roles... 
SPEAKER3 1:32:43
It's been a second. I assume an 11 does not though. 
SPEAKER4 1:32:45
No. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:46
No. 
SPEAKER5 1:32:48
It tries to hit, but you're pretty strong. You Mumbai yah. 
SPEAKER3 1:32:50
You're able to, you know, kind of like a cat trying to not go through a door. He arms out against the cave wall and it just chomps into the open space ahead of you. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:56
And it just chomps into the open space ahead of you. And it just chomps into the open space ahead of you. 
SPEAKER3 1:32:58
The moistness of the acid that fills its mouth that you now see and smell that burns the inside of your nostrils becomes clearly evident. mean bite yes it's nasty it doesn't floss top of the round before jizzard everyone else what

SPEAKER4 1:37:46
your speed is doubled you have plus two to your r1 class you have an advantage on the stare to save andros and gain an additional action on each turn or you've been turbocharged 
SPEAKER3 1:37:56
you are now a blender i get an additional 
SPEAKER2 1:38:00
yeah for a total of four attacks per turn 
SPEAKER4 1:38:04
uh question are we back on the one minute timer for combat uh 
SPEAKER7 1:38:10
good reminder i forgot about that 
SPEAKER5 1:38:12

SPEAKER2 1:38:20
uh uh uh 
SPEAKER4 1:38:26
uh 
SPEAKER2 1:38:28

SPEAKER1 1:39:42
me 
SPEAKER2 1:39:44
at 
SPEAKER3 1:39:46
Okay, six damage? Cool. It is suffering. 
SPEAKER5 1:39:50
You can tell it's barely holding its form together. The pseudopod that is holding onto you 
SPEAKER3 1:39:54
is like one of the only ones that is left. It's what you could kind of identify as a face with all the eyes and the maw is slack on one side dying off. It's not long for this world. 
SPEAKER1 1:40:09
Again! Again! 
SPEAKER4 1:40:10
Again! 
SPEAKER1 1:40:14
Yeah, 22. 
SPEAKER5 1:40:16
Yeah, that'll do it. That'll hit. 
SPEAKER3 1:40:17
How are you going to end this one? 
SPEAKER5 1:40:21
God damn. 
SPEAKER2 1:40:22
Go sleep. Go sleep. 
SPEAKER4 1:40:24
I'm just, with the haste that's through my body it's going to flurry and act just until it is minced. 
SPEAKER3 1:40:35
This first movement gets minced into nothingness. 
SPEAKER4 1:40:41
Then I turn my attention to the other one. Is it just like sticking to something? 
SPEAKER5 1:40:46
Gizzard has like a pseudopod against 
SPEAKER3 1:40:48
kind of his midsection and then he's kind of 
SPEAKER5 1:40:50
laying across one now 
SPEAKER3 1:40:51
as his arm up to like his wrist is now adhered to the same pseudopod. 
SPEAKER1 1:41:01
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:41:03
I'm just gonna 
SPEAKER2 1:41:04
like slash at whatever part of the thing 
SPEAKER4 1:41:10
is most exposed. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:12
Yes. Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 1:41:16
18. 
SPEAKER5 1:41:19
That'll hit. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:20
That'll do it. 
SPEAKER1 1:41:22
That'll do it. That'll do what you gotta do. 
SPEAKER2 1:41:25
That's still 
SPEAKER4 1:41:26
5 damage. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:28
Alright, alright, alright. And one more time. 
SPEAKER2 1:41:33
Just so my timers run out. 
SPEAKER4 1:41:36
Ooh, does a 10 hit? 
SPEAKER2 1:41:37
Oh shit. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:38
A 10 does not. 
SPEAKER4 1:41:40
Oh, but I can use guidance. 
SPEAKER7 1:41:43
That would have ended a while ago. That would have ended by now. 
SPEAKER2 1:41:46
God, shh. Alright, alright. 
SPEAKER4 1:41:52
All good things must come to an end. And then, yeah, I guess I'm gonna 
SPEAKER2 1:41:58
shout Are you guys coming? 
SPEAKER1 1:42:02
Hello? 
SPEAKER4 1:42:06
It's been a good solid like 20 seconds 
SPEAKER2 1:42:08
since we've seen 
SPEAKER4 1:42:10
the group. Yeah, and then that's my turn. 
SPEAKER3 1:42:14
Okay, no response echoes back to you. Which brings us to its turn. 
SPEAKER1 1:42:22
Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. 
SPEAKER3 1:42:25
This totally didn't fuck up my plans. 
SPEAKER5 1:42:28
It is going to... 
SPEAKER3 1:42:30
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 1:42:33
It's gonna hit you with a pseudopod orb. 
SPEAKER3 1:42:36
I'm gonna need to know. 
SPEAKER5 1:42:38
Does a... 
SPEAKER3 1:42:39
Does a 6 hit? 
SPEAKER1 1:42:43
No. 
SPEAKER5 1:42:44
No. 
SPEAKER3 1:42:44
Okay, cool. 
SPEAKER5 1:42:46
And then it's gonna try and... 
SPEAKER3 1:42:47
Actually, no, I don't have multi-attack on this one. 
SPEAKER5 1:42:51
Yeah, that's all it can fucking do, 
SPEAKER3 1:42:53
to be honest. It just kind of sits there and grumbles. Grumbles angrily into your face. The spittle leaking out of its lower jaw. That's its turn. 
SPEAKER2 1:43:14
Top of the round. 
SPEAKER3 1:43:16
Everyone else who's not in combat. 
SPEAKER5 1:43:19
Y'all continuing? 
SPEAKER1 1:43:22
Yep. 
SPEAKER5 1:43:22
Yep. 
SPEAKER7 1:43:22
Yep. We won't. We're gonna run closely for a direction and exit somewhere. 
SPEAKER5 1:43:29
Okay, so I will say... 
SPEAKER3 1:43:31
I will ask and say, Janune, did you take the second Mastiff with you? 
SPEAKER2 1:43:41
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 1:43:42
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 1:43:46
Okay. Nope. Don't need to measure. Okay, cool. I need to give it visibility. 
SPEAKER5 1:44:02
Yoink. Yoink. 
SPEAKER3 1:44:05
Vision range. What is the vision range of a Mastiff? That's a good question. And... It has true sight. If your Mastiff has true sight, you're having a bad time. 
SPEAKER2 1:44:21
The Mastiff has the wish spell. 
SPEAKER3 1:44:25
The Mastiff does not have... true sight... or vision. It cannot see. 
SPEAKER4 1:44:33
It does not have the wish spell. 
SPEAKER3 1:44:34
It can't see in the dark. According to its stat block, it cannot see in the dark. 
SPEAKER7 1:44:40
But it can smell. 
SPEAKER6 1:44:41
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 1:44:41
It can see me, though. 
SPEAKER5 1:44:44
Oy! 
SPEAKER3 1:44:44
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 1:44:45
Uh... 
SPEAKER6 1:44:45
Uh... 
SPEAKER3 1:44:46
Jizzard, that's one of the two. 
SPEAKER7 1:44:49
Birdman, 
SPEAKER1 1:44:50
give me some light around here, please. 
SPEAKER5 1:44:53
As you hear, 
SPEAKER3 1:44:55
the dog starts whining in the darkness. 
SPEAKER6 1:44:57
Blind. 
SPEAKER1 1:45:00
A baby! I'm sure I can see well, but it seems everybody else can't. All the dogs had night vision. 
SPEAKER5 1:45:09
According to D&D, 
SPEAKER3 1:45:10
they do not. 
SPEAKER1 1:45:13
Wait, cats? They don't have... They don't have... They don't have light vision. Cats have... Cats have night vision? 
SPEAKER7 1:45:19
What do you mean? 
SPEAKER1 1:45:20
Cats have... No, cats' eyes are reflective, so they can funnel more light into... Technically, nothing has night vision, except for stuff like snakes, which can sense heat more. 
SPEAKER4 1:45:30
But cats just... 
SPEAKER1 1:45:31
So if it's dark, cats reflect the light because of their eyes. That's why they have the eye shine. But they... If there's no light, they can't see anything. 
SPEAKER7 1:45:39
Yeah, yeah. 
SPEAKER3 1:45:40
But... 
SPEAKER1 1:45:42
Unless... Bird, please? 
SPEAKER2 1:45:44
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 1:45:45
Isan will go up to the dog 
SPEAKER3 1:45:48
and cast light on its collar. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:45:54
What's the range of bright and the range of dim? 
SPEAKER7 1:45:59
You have the spell, Devin. 
SPEAKER3 1:46:00
You can just activate it. 
SPEAKER1 1:46:01
I could. Bright light for a 20-foot radius and then additional dim light for another 20 feet. 
SPEAKER2 1:46:09
I could. Jesus Christ. Flashbang in the dark. Flash... 
SPEAKER3 1:46:13
You all get flashbanged, 
SPEAKER7 1:46:14
those of you who have dark vision, 
SPEAKER1 1:46:15
as daylight level light just emanates from this dog's collar. 
SPEAKER5 1:46:16
It then barks twice, in a very jovial manner, and it begins to track in this direction. 
SPEAKER3 1:46:19
And the... 
SPEAKER5 1:46:20
The elf, the floating pancake, 
SPEAKER3 1:46:22
begins to follow. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. 
SPEAKER2 1:46:30
Oh, no. Oh, no. 
SPEAKER3 1:46:32
Oh, no. 
SPEAKER7 1:46:33
Oh, no. 
SPEAKER3 1:46:34
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. 
SPEAKER2 1:46:39
Oh, no. 
SPEAKER1 1:46:40
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Boy. Where's the other out boy? Why? 
SPEAKER3 1:46:47
What? 
SPEAKER1 1:46:48
What is that? What... Boy what? What is what? 
SPEAKER5 1:46:52
Contandal boy? 
SPEAKER2 1:47:06
That is... 
SPEAKER1 1:47:07
Cursed. Certainly. Wait, you guys don't know the Ash Baby meme? No. 
SPEAKER3 1:47:13
It was all over TikTok. 
SPEAKER1 1:47:18
Boy, I forgot the name of TikTok. I forgot what it was called. Oh, okay. There's like a goofy audio. Okay. Well, anyways, that's everyone getting flashbanged. 
SPEAKER7 1:47:33
Mishi is going to follow his dog and question the little squishy. Is this route safe? 
SPEAKER3 1:47:38
As you put that thought in the air, it responds, safer, yes. 
SPEAKER7 1:47:45
Good. 
SPEAKER3 1:47:46
The dog then begins to make its way down this very narrow crevice. 
SPEAKER1 1:47:54
So the light is coming from the collar. Will that be reflected in the... 
SPEAKER3 1:48:03
In the Roll20? 
SPEAKER1 1:48:06
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:06
I mean, it should be coming from the dog. The dog itself, yes. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:11
You just turned this dog into a light weapon. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:14
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:15
Can you... 
SPEAKER5 1:48:16
Koi, can you see the map? 
SPEAKER1 1:48:18
I can. It's just like... Ah! It's the same as before. Yeah. It's just like not showing light from the dog, so I can't really see what's ahead. 
SPEAKER5 1:48:30
Oh, hi. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:31
Now... Hi. 
SPEAKER5 1:48:33
You need vision. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:36
Where's my other dog? 
SPEAKER3 1:48:38
Uh, he left it with the jizzard. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:41
No, he came with... 
SPEAKER7 1:48:42
I think he said two. The first. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:44
No, I said both of them came. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:47
Oh, both of them came. 
SPEAKER1 1:48:49
Yeah. Well... Also, you're missing one of the pancakes over there. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:56
Uh, yes. I know. He didn't follow. 
SPEAKER7 1:48:59
Oh. Too many pancakes to control. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:02
Listen, chief, you're not taking the entire IHOP with you. 
SPEAKER4 1:49:06
I'm not taking the whole IHOP with you. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:07
I'm just saying. 
SPEAKER1 1:49:08
I'm just saying. I'm just saying. 
SPEAKER2 1:49:08
I can't believe you guys are stopping. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:09
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:49:10
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:11
Alright, so both dogs came with them. This is gonna be a lot of tokens to control very soon. 
SPEAKER2 1:49:19
Right. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:20
Completely. 
SPEAKER4 1:49:21
I'm squishing away a little here. 
SPEAKER5 1:49:25
So you guys start squeezing through the narrow passageways. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:28
A different floating pancake that you guys hadn't necessarily seen starts to begin to bookend the end. And one more joins as well. 
SPEAKER2 1:49:37
Oh. 
SPEAKER7 1:49:38
Meechee's going to rub up against the wall, get that nasty stuff off of her. Just forcing everybody else behind him to kind of get it. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:48
Evil. 
SPEAKER7 1:49:54
Anyway, carry on. 
SPEAKER5 1:49:57
So, with that, we go back to our combat. Jizzard! 
SPEAKER3 1:50:00
What are you up to? 
SPEAKER4 1:50:01
I'm going to use the hand that's still free and try and shock and grasp this jaunt. 
SPEAKER3 1:50:07
Cool. 
SPEAKER5 1:50:09
Go ahead. 
SPEAKER1 1:50:12
14. 
SPEAKER5 1:50:13
14 on hit, yeah, that'll do it. 
SPEAKER1 1:50:15
Yee-hee! 
SPEAKER2 1:50:17
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:50:18
Jesus Christ. 
SPEAKER2 1:50:20
2. 
SPEAKER4 1:50:22
D. 
SPEAKER2 1:50:23
A. 
SPEAKER1 1:50:26
Bam, bam! 
SPEAKER4 1:50:27
14 damage. Or just bam. Not even bam. 
SPEAKER3 1:50:32
Buzz buzz, bitch. 
SPEAKER1 1:50:35
Buzz buzz. 
SPEAKER5 1:50:37
Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. The ring of fire. The ring of lightning. 
SPEAKER3 1:50:44
As lightning courses through this creature's body, you feel that the pseudopod that is currently adhered to you tense up as the entire physicality begins to tighten and then release again. You've given it a solid hit as it belches forth some of the acid that makes up its digestive system. 
SPEAKER1 1:51:01
Oh. 
SPEAKER4 1:51:04
Yeah? 
SPEAKER5 1:51:04
Which brings us to Ord's turn. 
SPEAKER3 1:51:06
Ord, what are you up to? 
SPEAKER4 1:51:08
I can slash. 
SPEAKER2 1:51:10
I can slash. 
SPEAKER4 1:51:13
I'm going up. 
SPEAKER5 1:51:14
I'm up. 
SPEAKER4 1:51:19
18 hit. 
SPEAKER3 1:51:20
18 will. All right. You cleave into it once. 
SPEAKER2 1:51:34
I can't do it. 
SPEAKER3 1:51:37
It's still standing. But, you know, it's had an axe sunk into it. 
SPEAKER1 1:51:42
16. 
SPEAKER5 1:51:42
Will also hit. 
SPEAKER3 1:51:43
Go ahead. 
SPEAKER5 1:51:44
Roll damage. 
SPEAKER4 1:51:45
Watch out. No, it doesn't have the damage. That's a tag. 
SPEAKER5 1:51:50
Smooth. 
SPEAKER3 1:51:51
We'll count that as an extra one. Okay. Another six. 
SPEAKER5 1:51:55
Or another eight. 
SPEAKER4 1:51:56
Eight damage. 
SPEAKER1 1:51:56
Yes. 
SPEAKER2 1:51:57
Eight to the cock. 
SPEAKER3 1:51:59
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:52:00
19 also hits. 
SPEAKER5 1:52:01
Yep. 
SPEAKER2 1:52:03
Watch out. 
SPEAKER4 1:52:05
Follow up to the poobah. 
SPEAKER2 1:52:06
All right. 12. 
SPEAKER6 1:52:08
12. 
SPEAKER2 1:52:10
Yep. 
SPEAKER3 1:52:12
All right. 
SPEAKER1 1:52:13
Finish. 
SPEAKER5 1:52:14
Jesus. 
SPEAKER4 1:52:15
Does it need another one? 
SPEAKER5 1:52:17
It is still standing. 
SPEAKER4 1:52:19
Does it learn? It hasn't learned. 
SPEAKER3 1:52:29
10 to it? 
SPEAKER5 1:52:32
How do you want to end it? 
SPEAKER6 1:52:33
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:52:36
In a. 
SPEAKER2 1:52:36
Beautiful. Explosion. 
SPEAKER4 1:52:38
Guts. 
SPEAKER2 1:52:39
And fluids. 
SPEAKER4 1:52:40
And. Acid. 
SPEAKER6 1:52:42
And. 
SPEAKER3 1:52:43
That. 
SPEAKER5 1:52:44
Just what you see is the shimmering vibrating form of Ord just immediately. 
SPEAKER3 1:52:51
Swing for rapid successions and blender this thing. The pseudopod that is that is here to you falls and stops off as you are now covered in the blended form of this mimic. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:03
Oh, yeah. Plan B came to fruition. We should. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:07
So we are now out of common initiative. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:13
There never has something so gross and so beautiful. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:17
I assume once again, just saying this all out loud. 
SPEAKER1 1:53:23
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:23
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 1:53:27
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:53:33
And now what are the two of you doing? 
SPEAKER1 1:53:34
I'm going to try to get them. Are you going to try and look them? 
SPEAKER7 1:53:37
Are you all right? 
SPEAKER3 1:53:38
This is the flight. 
SPEAKER5 1:53:39
Like you. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:40
Right. Is it? 
SPEAKER3 1:53:42
You're all right. 
SPEAKER1 1:53:43
I'm doing. You should. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:45
We should probably be careful though. 
SPEAKER1 1:53:46
Because immediately. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:47
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:48
This. 
SPEAKER1 1:53:49
This little. 
SPEAKER7 1:53:50
This. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:51
You know, my arm is still technically attached. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:52
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. 
SPEAKER3 1:53:55
I'm not. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:56
I'm not. 
SPEAKER4 1:53:57
I'm not. I'm not. 
SPEAKER2 1:53:59
I'm not. 
SPEAKER1 1:54:00
I'm not. 
SPEAKER4 1:54:01
I'm not. 
SPEAKER2 1:54:02
I'm not. 
SPEAKER1 1:54:03
Not much. 
SPEAKER2 1:54:05
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 1:54:08
We should. 
SPEAKER4 1:54:09
Where? Where is everybody? They were following a little squishy dude that went into like a crevice back here on 
SPEAKER2 1:54:19
her. 
SPEAKER4 1:54:21
What's this little like pilot crab in the corner? 
SPEAKER3 1:54:29
Well, you do as you go and roll an investigation check. 
SPEAKER5 1:54:33
for me, Gizzard. 
SPEAKER4 1:54:39
Can I make it anything else? 
SPEAKER3 1:54:45
Perception. 
SPEAKER6 1:54:45
Perception. 
SPEAKER4 1:54:48
What you find is behind 
SPEAKER3 1:54:53
what was the body of this 
SPEAKER2 1:54:55
thing is a small pile of bones. Humanoid bones. You find three gold coins and you find a potion bottle. Oh, the microphone didn't 
SPEAKER4 1:55:07
pick that up. I did a gipy, but it was too high pitched. 
SPEAKER3 1:55:11
Yep. 
SPEAKER7 1:55:13
It's an empty bottle. 
SPEAKER3 1:55:15
Nope. It is a potion. You have not identified it yet. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:22
An intriguing... 
SPEAKER1 1:55:25
Do the 
SPEAKER4 1:55:25
pile of bones, like, could they add up to the size of what was the 
SPEAKER3 1:55:29
form? It could indeed. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:31
Oh, sad. 
SPEAKER4 1:55:33
It's kind of tragic. Someone came down here and got their ass handed to them and their form 
SPEAKER2 1:55:43
copied. 
SPEAKER3 1:55:45
And you find with those bones the tatters 
SPEAKER2 1:55:47
of a small leather bag. 
SPEAKER3 1:55:50
Which is where you find all of the other stuff that's in it. The gold and the bottle, the potion. 
SPEAKER4 1:55:55
Is there any, like, identification? Anything that could be symbolic of what we were, what the person was? Like, is there, like, a name etched into the bag or something? 
SPEAKER3 1:56:09
There is a message etched into the top of the 
SPEAKER6 1:56:11
bag. 
SPEAKER3 1:56:13
It says, From your loving mother, should you follow in my footsteps? 
SPEAKER4 1:56:21
That's so fucking sad. I'm gonna take it with me. 
SPEAKER1 1:56:26
Uh, would Jizzer have known what the two twins looked like 
SPEAKER7 1:56:29
since he kind of went through all their 
SPEAKER2 1:56:31
pictures and imagery? The house. Paintings. 
SPEAKER3 1:56:37
So, yes. 
SPEAKER5 1:56:39
Those of you who would have been at 
SPEAKER3 1:56:41
Charlotte's house, especially during the initial investigation, would have gotten a description and seen the various different paintings. These children were young. And these bones are adolescent. They're older. So the bones don't match up to what those children could have been. 
SPEAKER4 1:56:58
Very well. 
SPEAKER7 1:57:02
I know nothing of this, but I... 
SPEAKER5 1:57:03
You know nothing of this. True. 
SPEAKER3 1:57:05
But, Jizzard, I'm gonna give you this even though you rolled a 12. 
SPEAKER5 1:57:08
These are clearly bones that are closer to adult 
SPEAKER3 1:57:11
than the children you're looking at. 
SPEAKER4 1:57:13
Yeah, I was guessing the form was a bit too large. 
SPEAKER2 1:57:15
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 1:57:19
What was the message again? Can you just type that out so I can get it down there? I'm trying to write it. I'm trying to actually take notes. I am taking the bag tatters with me. 
SPEAKER3 1:57:49
There you go. 
SPEAKER4 1:57:49
There we go. 
SPEAKER3 1:57:52
It's in roll 20. 
SPEAKER4 1:57:54
I see. I'll say the order. Alright. I'm taking these bag tatters with me. 
SPEAKER2 1:58:02
Yeah. You should probably catch up 
SPEAKER4 1:58:05
before you get too tired to move. Yeah. Which will happen when your haste runs out, unfortunately. Sorry. 
SPEAKER1 1:58:17
Oh. Thank you. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 1:58:21
Okay. So. What is everyone doing? 
SPEAKER7 1:58:28
I'm continuing on. 
SPEAKER3 1:58:31
I'm going to... 
SPEAKER1 1:58:31
I'm going to... 
SPEAKER4 1:58:32
I'm doing the last chase and saw the group. 
SPEAKER3 1:58:36
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:58:37
Ored and Jizzard, 
SPEAKER3 1:58:38
what you see is there is one 
SPEAKER1 1:58:40
pancake floaty guy 
SPEAKER3 1:58:41
that is still outside of the crevice here. As you round the corner, it gestures to you to follow. 
SPEAKER4 1:58:50
I'm going to follow it, not because it told me to, but because it's going the same direction that we need to go. 
SPEAKER3 1:59:00
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:59:01
That's... That's... 
SPEAKER4 1:59:02
Found logic to me. 
SPEAKER3 1:59:03
It leads you into this cavern. At which point, I need to know the rest of the party. 
SPEAKER5 1:59:16
Y'all are just continuing downward? 
SPEAKER1 1:59:18
Yep. Isang will continue, but he'll be looking, like, very cautiously. So could he kind of, like, 
SPEAKER3 1:59:28
just kind of be, like, 
SPEAKER1 1:59:29
he's just kind of looking around to, like, try to make sure there's nothing weird 
SPEAKER7 1:59:33
or just observing his surroundings very carefully. 
SPEAKER3 1:59:36
Sure. Roll a perception check for me. 
SPEAKER1 1:59:38
Alright. I'm still gonna be, like, keeping to the sides as we're moving forward and attempting to stay hidden as best as I can. 
SPEAKER3 1:59:47
Roll another stealth check for me. 
SPEAKER1 1:59:48
I'm not directly following people. And, um, yeah. Uh. 26. 
SPEAKER7 1:59:56
Michi is going to make mocking jokes at the cavern. 
SPEAKER1 1:59:59
Park, park, right, huh? Right, park, park. 26, 7. 
SPEAKER6 2:00:10
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 2:00:10
I still have the head up. 
SPEAKER6 2:00:12
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 2:00:19
Junun is not amused. 
SPEAKER1 2:00:21
Sorry. You don't got really a barking personality, do you? Sorry, I got distracted. 
SPEAKER7 2:00:30
Are you looking the walls? 
SPEAKER3 2:00:31
Michi is mocking you. With the dogs. Junun. 
SPEAKER1 2:00:37
Why is he mocking me? Because you're not paying attention to anything. 
SPEAKER7 2:00:44
Also because we were making jokes about the dogs earlier. Pretending to, you know, speak dog. So, you know, Michi's like, I'll teach you how to speak dog. She doesn't actually know how to fucking speak dog. She's just joking that you don't either. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:01
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:01:02
So, I'm going to ask you a question. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:03
So, I'm going to ask you a question. 
SPEAKER5 2:01:03
Okay. So, I'm going to ask you a question. 
SPEAKER3 2:01:03
Alf is moving forward as well. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:05
Okay. 
SPEAKER7 2:01:06
So, as we all move forward, 
SPEAKER5 2:01:08
in Songhang, here's what you pick up on 
SPEAKER3 2:01:10
with your perception roll. This cave, this part is, 
SPEAKER5 2:01:18
the humidity here has gone up. 
SPEAKER3 2:01:19
It is kind of cold. The walls themselves are slick with moisture, but it's quiet. The noises that you make reverberate much more. It's a smaller cavern. And the entire area, the area that you're now going to has a downward gradient to it. You're going down further, but less extreme than that giant climb you just made. The air smells, and it does smell salty. Briny, one would say. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:48
Briny? 
SPEAKER3 2:01:49
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:50
And I guess, is the smell getting stronger as we go down? 
SPEAKER3 2:01:56
Yes. Yes, it is. 
SPEAKER7 2:02:00
Is it comparable? 
SPEAKER1 2:02:01
Is it comparable to anything I would know? I'm trying to picture the smell. 
SPEAKER3 2:02:07
Right now, 
SPEAKER5 2:02:09
the thing that it's most comparable to, 
SPEAKER6 2:02:12
um, 
SPEAKER2 2:02:14
swamp area, 
SPEAKER7 2:02:16
or sea water and swamp ass. Essentially. 
SPEAKER5 2:02:20
Yeah, it's sea water. It's sea water light. 
SPEAKER1 2:02:23
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:02:24
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 2:02:25
It's not like, 
SPEAKER3 2:02:25
it's not like you're on the edge of a pier at a fishery getting full ass brine and fish smell. It's kind of like you're getting a little bit of ocean spray while you're in the upper class areas that, 
SPEAKER5 2:02:36
you know, 
SPEAKER3 2:02:36
they built their house near it. It's sea brine on the wind. 
SPEAKER1 2:02:41
And it doesn't seem like there's any perceivable dangers right now. 
SPEAKER6 2:02:46
Not yet. 
SPEAKER1 2:02:48
All right. 
SPEAKER3 2:02:49
Alf continues ahead of Michi. 
SPEAKER5 2:02:53
The, 
SPEAKER2 2:02:53
um, 
SPEAKER3 2:02:56
the mastiff that is also tracking can use sniffing, sniffing the ground in that area, and leads you forward. Jizzard and Ord, the creature that you're following, meets up with two more of its kind, and all three of them begin to move forward. 
SPEAKER1 2:03:12
Oop, 
SPEAKER4 2:03:12
did I see anything in this little crevice that, 
SPEAKER2 2:03:14
that, 
SPEAKER4 2:03:16
that passing? 
SPEAKER3 2:03:17
Just rock. 
SPEAKER4 2:03:18
I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 2:03:19
They move forward. And then eventually, 
SPEAKER7 2:03:22
one by one, 
SPEAKER3 2:03:23
go further into the crevice ahead of them. 
SPEAKER1 2:03:28
Yoink. 
SPEAKER3 2:03:29
Yoink. Yoink. 
SPEAKER1 2:03:36
Yeesh. 
SPEAKER2 2:03:37
Yeah, 
SPEAKER3 2:03:38
that's not what I needed. I need this. Yoink. 
SPEAKER1 2:03:45
Oh, 
SPEAKER4 2:03:46
this is like the perfect napkin spot. Look at this. Check it out, 
SPEAKER1 2:03:52
Ord. 
SPEAKER3 2:03:54
Yoink. 
SPEAKER4 2:03:56
It's like a little napkin corner. 
SPEAKER2 2:03:58
Kind of small. 
SPEAKER3 2:03:59
I think, uh, 
SPEAKER6 2:03:59
I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, 
SPEAKER1 2:04:01
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 2:04:03
Hmm? 
SPEAKER4 2:04:03
Look. 
SPEAKER1 2:04:05
Fours, 
SPEAKER3 2:04:05
as you're kind of staying behind, 
SPEAKER5 2:04:06
you now hear Jizzard 
SPEAKER3 2:04:08
behind you, catching up, talking to Ord. 
SPEAKER1 2:04:14
Uh, okay. I, do I hear anybody with them? 
SPEAKER3 2:04:24
It depends. 
SPEAKER5 2:04:25
How subtle are you trying to be, Ord? 
SPEAKER3 2:04:29
I'm not, 
SPEAKER6 2:04:29
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, 
SPEAKER1 2:04:30
I'm not, 
SPEAKER3 2:04:33
Then, yeah. 
SPEAKER1 2:04:38
So I hear, I hear Jizzard and Ord, and that's it. 
SPEAKER4 2:04:41
Does Ord not want to, 
SPEAKER1 2:04:42
not, not wantございます. Well, 
SPEAKER4 2:04:49
I just 
SPEAKER2 2:04:49
saw someone 
SPEAKER4 2:04:50
taking a 
SPEAKER3 2:04:51
permanent nap 
SPEAKER1 2:04:53
in here, so 
SPEAKER2 2:04:53
not the best 
SPEAKER4 2:04:55
idea. Your boy EP. 
SPEAKER2 2:05:03
Never found the others. Yeah, right. 
SPEAKER1 2:05:11
Did I just hear the two of them? Mhm. Do they sound like themselves? 
SPEAKER3 2:05:17
Make a perception check. Or an insight check. 
SPEAKER4 2:05:21
I mean... 
SPEAKER1 2:05:23
It's like... Uh, 26. 
SPEAKER3 2:05:29
Yeah, they sound like them. 
SPEAKER1 2:05:33
Okay. Um... I'm gonna retreat a little more into the shadows. And... Wait for them to pass me by. 
SPEAKER3 2:05:45
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 2:05:47
Everyone else, you can move your tokens. 
SPEAKER3 2:05:49
I'm going to just move Pancake and Mastiff. 
SPEAKER4 2:05:51
So you move... Sorry, I need to check something. 
SPEAKER1 2:05:55
Freedom, I'm moving on. Um... Question... So, this is a question to Kaylin and Devin. Because I'm not sure how we're... We plan on running this. The Eros that Kaylin and I have... The message spell, does it have to be... Is it spoken? Or, like... It's just walkie-talkie. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:06:19
But you have to speak. 
SPEAKER1 2:06:21
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then, if I speak and you reply... Would they hear it? 
SPEAKER7 2:06:27
No. I don't think so. I think it would just be tuned to that person's ear. Since it's literally just an earring. 
SPEAKER1 2:06:33
Okay. How far ahead of me are they? Uh... 
SPEAKER4 2:06:39
We could be up to five minutes. 
SPEAKER1 2:06:41
How far ahead is Hunter and Orton? 
SPEAKER3 2:06:43
Mmm... 
SPEAKER5 2:06:45
Well, you can tell based on where you're hearing them 
SPEAKER3 2:06:47
and if they're in the crevice ahead of you that you came from. 15, 20 feet. 
SPEAKER1 2:06:53
Okay. Uh, I'm just gonna mutter into the earring, um... They're coming, I'll follow after them. 
SPEAKER7 2:07:05
Can you repeat that one more time for me? 
SPEAKER3 2:07:07
I thought you just said the world's full of autism. 
SPEAKER1 2:07:09
They're coming, I'll follow after them. 
SPEAKER3 2:07:13
Oh, okay. Understood. 
SPEAKER7 2:07:15
Care. 
SPEAKER1 2:07:17
And then I will wait for them to pass me by. And I'm trying to say it like... I'm trying to say it like... I'm trying to be quiet-ish, so I'm not like... 
SPEAKER3 2:07:25
You know. 
SPEAKER2 2:07:27
A little bit of self-confusion, not just screaming. 
SPEAKER1 2:07:29
A little bit of self-confusion, not just screaming. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 
SPEAKER7 2:07:35
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:07:37
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 2:07:39
Jizudyn ord, you can move your tokens 
SPEAKER3 2:07:41
however you need to to catch up. 
SPEAKER4 2:07:43
Okay. Mm-hm. We're inching along through the cave, um... however I can get through. 
SPEAKER1 2:07:51
What a twist, it went this way. 
SPEAKER4 2:07:55
I want to get close to these flumps. Do they get the fuck out of my way, or do I have to get close to them? 
SPEAKER3 2:08:02
They do kind of float around you, but they eventually do leave your space as they move upwards. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:09
They're in brawlhole airspace. 
SPEAKER3 2:08:12
Michi and Janune, the first master, the one with the light around the collar, eventually reaches the trail. From here now, you can see the cave really has one direction that they're basically going in. And they lead you around. 
SPEAKER1 2:08:26
Uh, uh, uh. 
SPEAKER3 2:08:29
Uh. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:38
Do I see Fours here? 
SPEAKER3 2:08:41
Fours is stealthed, so I will actually help that. 
SPEAKER1 2:08:44
I also have my hood up. So if you're going to get in the way, you can just go in the middle of the trail. If you're trying to see me, you have to roll with disadvantage. 
SPEAKER3 2:08:50
Yup. As the master approaches here, and Alf, the flump that is accompanying you, gets close. It kind of makes a kind of deflating sound, and signals to you, Janune, to be quiet. And then signals, this is near the end. There is danger ahead. 
SPEAKER2 2:09:18
The land of all. Whisper. 
SPEAKER7 2:09:29
Then why are we going this way? 
SPEAKER3 2:09:33
There is more to what you seek. And the mastiff continues onward in the darkness. And reaches a branching path. 
SPEAKER7 2:09:46
Janune will continue with stealth. 
SPEAKER3 2:09:51
Okay, roll stealth for me, please. And roll stealth for the mastiff as well. Okay. 
SPEAKER7 2:10:01
Would, uh, Michi be watching? 
SPEAKER1 2:10:04
I don't know how to roll stealth for the mastiff. 
SPEAKER3 2:10:07
If you click on it twice, it will pull up a stat block. And stealth is a dexterity check. 
SPEAKER7 2:10:11
Oh, dexterity, okay. 
SPEAKER4 2:10:14
Well, you can do that for characters as well, that's awesome. 
SPEAKER7 2:10:17
Michi would have seen this weird behavior, right? 
SPEAKER3 2:10:20
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER7 2:10:21
I'm gonna Q and all this shit. Sounds pretty quiet. 
SPEAKER3 2:10:25
In a walking tone. 
SPEAKER1 2:10:27
Uh, by the way, Devon, we can see the thing that you just rolled. 
SPEAKER3 2:10:31
Mm. 
SPEAKER1 2:10:33
Um, Isonkan will also try to hide. 
SPEAKER7 2:10:37
Thank you for the mirror. 
SPEAKER2 2:10:41
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:10:43
I feel like we need to have a one-shot of Bors teaching Isonkan how to hide. 
SPEAKER3 2:10:48
Mm-hmm. Do we? Do we? 
SPEAKER1 2:10:51
Oh! Isonkan becomes one of the shadows. He's just fucking like... 
SPEAKER2 2:10:57
Psh. 
SPEAKER1 2:10:58
I guess Isonkan is learning. 
SPEAKER7 2:11:00
Michi is fucking doomed. 
SPEAKER3 2:11:04
The flump moves up a bit here. The mastiff continues forward. Until it reaches the end. You can hear it stop. Michi is in stealth, by the way. 
SPEAKER7 2:11:18
I think. 
SPEAKER3 2:11:19
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 2:11:21
Jun-Nun is also going to put on his cloak and his mask. 
SPEAKER2 2:11:26
Just in case. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:11:36
As you all stealthily pass the Y Junction, you see, as you take a look through it, this small cave, like another cave connection. This one, both walls studded and overgrown with crystals. These pale blue crystal overgrowths. And through it, you can see, on the ground, this small form. About the size of the same humanoid creatures that you found earlier. This one, the chest slowly heaving and breathing. 
SPEAKER2 2:12:05
As if it's asleep. 
SPEAKER3 2:12:09
As the mastiff comes to the end of this part of the cave, what you see is a little bit of a gap. This is the bottom of the cave. What you see is yet another opening in the ground that leads down. This one, not as narrow as the previous one that you had to climb to get into this. It's a good seven feet in diameter. So you can fit down here and you can climb down the rock face normally without being constricted. This time, you can also see the bottom. A good 30 to 40 feet below. For those of you with darkvision, that extends that far. The mastiff stands at the precipice here and wags its tail and pants over the edge. Jinoon, Insonghong, and Michi, you're the only ones there at the moment. Gizzard, Ord, and Fors, how far do you advance behind them? 
SPEAKER7 2:12:54
Michi is gonna contact in her radio real quick before they start doing that action. Do be careful. 
SPEAKER3 2:13:03
Stealth is best. I think Gizzard and Ord are left behind. 
SPEAKER2 2:13:05
I think Gizzard and Ord are left behind. 
SPEAKER1 2:13:06
I think Gizzard and Ord are left behind. 
SPEAKER4 2:13:07
I think Gizzard and Ord are left behind. 
SPEAKER1 2:13:08
I think Gizzard and Ord are left behind. I think Gizzard and Ord are left behind. I think Gizzard and Ord are left behind. I think G Website is right in the area with me, so I'm not gonna say anything, but I will hear it. 
SPEAKER7 2:13:13
Mhm. I mean, not like I need to tell you anyway, but just did it anyway. 
SPEAKER1 2:13:19
Which, actually, are they actively looking for me? 
SPEAKER3 2:13:22
They wouldn't know you're in the area. 
SPEAKER1 2:13:24
No. Okay. I thought that there was something said about looking. 
SPEAKER4 2:13:29
I mean, like, I can see your token, but Gizzard can't. 
SPEAKER2 2:13:34
There we go. I'm gonna go check the other side. 
SPEAKER4 2:13:39
Okay. No, no. 
SPEAKER2 2:13:41
No, I can't. 
SPEAKER3 2:13:42
So, Gizzard and Ord, then. Wait. Where are you, though? 
SPEAKER1 2:13:45
I put you in stealth. 
SPEAKER3 2:13:46
I can't see anything. 
SPEAKER1 2:13:47
Welcome back. 
SPEAKER2 2:13:48
Now I can see things. 
SPEAKER4 2:13:49
Mhm. 
SPEAKER1 2:13:50
That was weird. 
SPEAKER2 2:13:51
I can't see it. Woah! 
SPEAKER1 2:13:53
Yeah, it's because when I put you in stealth, it takes over your token. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 2:13:59
That's fine. I can see you. I can see you. 
SPEAKER1 2:14:02
I can see you. 
SPEAKER4 2:14:03
I can see you. 
SPEAKER1 2:14:04
I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. 
SPEAKER5 2:14:07
I can see you. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:08
I can see you. token. 
SPEAKER1 2:14:10
Ah, okay. 
SPEAKER4 2:14:11
I guess we'll plug along, but I'm not going to get too close to the squishy thing. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:17
It kind of just hovers in the space, gesturing. 
SPEAKER4 2:14:23
I don't like that. I'm going to give it as wide a burp as I can. Oh, God, there's another one. 
SPEAKER2 2:14:34
Plugging along. 
SPEAKER4 2:14:36
Refusing to get close to these things. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:39
Okay, Ord, are you following? 
SPEAKER5 2:14:45
Yep. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:47
Go ahead, move your token. 
SPEAKER4 2:14:50
What's this little pile of rubble? Is this a thing, or is it something? 
SPEAKER3 2:14:54
Nope. These are just collapsed walls and cavern walls. Collapsed cavern walls in stone. 
SPEAKER4 2:15:02
They look kind of shapely. Not like a good shapely, just like... 
SPEAKER2 2:15:08
Yeah, they're shapely. They do, in fact, exist. 
SPEAKER6 2:15:14
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 2:15:18
I should reach the corridor now. Alf, the pancake, but not one that you would know. You feel a presence that says, Quiet. There is danger ahead. For you, Desert. And you, Ord. 
SPEAKER5 2:15:33
Ew. 
SPEAKER4 2:15:35
Something's fucking whispering in my brain. 
SPEAKER2 2:15:39
I see a dog. Do I see this dog? 
SPEAKER3 2:15:42
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 2:15:43
Oh. There should be a dog over here. There's a puppy! 
SPEAKER3 2:15:46
You see a dog, and it eventually does make its way in the same direction you're traveling. 
SPEAKER4 2:15:51
Do I get to pet the dog before it goes away? 
SPEAKER2 2:15:54
Mmm. 
SPEAKER6 2:15:55
Or was it leaving as we entered this tunnel? 
SPEAKER3 2:15:58
It was kind of leaving as you entered. 
SPEAKER4 2:16:00
God damn it. 
SPEAKER1 2:16:01
Let me come back. Don't touch my dog. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:04
Where's this little fucking squishy bitch? 
SPEAKER4 2:16:07
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:16:08
Bye. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:09
Bye. 
SPEAKER4 2:16:09
Did I know that the whispering in my brain was coming from the squishy bitch? 
SPEAKER3 2:16:13
Not necessarily. It's not trying to hide, though. It is staring at you. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:26
Get it. 
SPEAKER1 2:16:27
Are you making these noises as you walk? 
SPEAKER3 2:16:29
Yes. Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER4 2:16:31
Get it. 
SPEAKER3 2:16:32
Bye. 
SPEAKER1 2:16:33
Get it. 
SPEAKER3 2:16:34
Are you being stealthy with this or not? 
SPEAKER1 2:16:37
Me? 
SPEAKER3 2:16:38
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 2:16:39
I mean, you just told me to be careful. 
SPEAKER7 2:16:41
Wouldn't Michi hear this? 
SPEAKER1 2:16:43
It doesn't mean that you are being careful. 
SPEAKER3 2:16:44
Michi, you can see them. 
SPEAKER1 2:16:45
That's why we're asking. 
SPEAKER3 2:16:46
If you turn around, you can see them, Michi. 
SPEAKER5 2:16:48
But also, Jizzard, roll stealth. 
SPEAKER3 2:16:50
If you're gonna be stealthy. Same with Ord. 
SPEAKER4 2:16:52
I don't trust this little squishy bitch, but I guess I don't see the point in not being cautious. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:59
Should I roll stealth? 
SPEAKER4 2:17:00
Yep. 
SPEAKER3 2:17:01
Yes, please. 
SPEAKER1 2:17:03
12. 
SPEAKER2 2:17:04
Or no, 18. 
SPEAKER4 2:17:05
12. 
SPEAKER2 2:17:06
Or not 18. 12. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 2:17:09
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 2:17:10
Wall is fucking numbered. 
SPEAKER1 2:17:11
Uh, Bone? 
SPEAKER3 2:17:12
Fuck. 
SPEAKER2 2:17:13
Hell yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:17:14
Michi. At first, you don't notice Jizzard. Despite his many noises. What you do notice is Ord bumping into every wall and kicking every stone as he inches through this corridor. Which is what alerts you to turn around and see them behind you. Um, Michi's just gonna look. 
SPEAKER7 2:17:37
Mechie's just gonna look and fucking cure me as my leg. Alright, y'all. Cool. And just... And utterance of just... 
SPEAKER3 2:17:48
Shut them up. 
SPEAKER7 2:17:50
Do the little, uh... Radio. They're too loud. They're too loud for this. 
SPEAKER1 2:18:01
What do you do? 
SPEAKER3 2:18:02
Do you want me to... 
SPEAKER1 2:18:03
Choke them out? 
SPEAKER3 2:18:04
He might like that, but don't do that. Just... Can't tell them to be quiet. 
SPEAKER1 2:18:12
I'm gonna ominously stand behind them. And just go... 
SPEAKER2 2:18:17
Shh. 
SPEAKER1 2:18:18
I'm gonna scare them, brother. 
SPEAKER4 2:18:22
I mean, they're gonna be talking. 
SPEAKER5 2:18:24
Are you behind Gizzard or behind Ord? 
SPEAKER3 2:18:26
Because they are two different locations right now. 
SPEAKER1 2:18:28
Are they two different locations? I thought they were walking together. 
SPEAKER5 2:18:31
I mean, Ord's token hasn't moved. 
SPEAKER2 2:18:34
No, they're probably... 
SPEAKER1 2:18:35
I'm gonna just stand, like... 
SPEAKER6 2:18:37
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:18:38
Behind both of them. Not, like, not directly behind them. Sort of behind a rock. And I'm just gonna, like, shush them. 
SPEAKER3 2:18:44
From out of nowhere, the two of you hear a... 
SPEAKER6 2:18:47
Shh. 
SPEAKER4 2:18:49
Those fucking squishy bitches are trying to tell us what to do. 
SPEAKER5 2:18:52
Shh. 
SPEAKER7 2:18:53
Mechie exclaims. 
SPEAKER3 2:18:55
And as both of you come within range... Within the ability... 
SPEAKER5 2:18:58
Within vision... 
SPEAKER3 2:18:59
Visual sight of your... The rest of your party... You see a Y-path and a crystalline... Crevice. That leads to a different part of the cave. 
SPEAKER4 2:19:11
Do I see this thing down here, or no? 
SPEAKER3 2:19:14
Um... Are you looking through? 
SPEAKER1 2:19:17
I mean... 
SPEAKER5 2:19:17
Then yes. 
SPEAKER3 2:19:18
You see, as Ord is kicking every rock, and as... Forrest says, 
SPEAKER5 2:19:23
Shh! 
SPEAKER3 2:19:24
This creature stirs. As another one wakes up... And looks around. And matches eyes with you. 
SPEAKER1 2:19:32
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 2:19:34
Anyway, so... Hope you're all ready for combat again. 
SPEAKER1 2:19:42
Yay! None of us said anything. 
SPEAKER5 2:19:45
It's almost like you woke it up. 
SPEAKER7 2:19:48
The Wonder Twins. 
SPEAKER4 2:19:50
The Lord kicked a rock. 
SPEAKER5 2:19:53
Hey, it has... 
SPEAKER3 2:19:54
It has perception as well. Just saying. 
SPEAKER4 2:19:58
Passive perception? 
SPEAKER3 2:20:00
It does. 
SPEAKER6 2:20:01
Passive perception? 
SPEAKER4 2:20:03
Passive perception? Passive perception? 
SPEAKER6 2:20:04
Passive perception? 
SPEAKER1 2:20:04
Passive perception? Passive perception? Passive perception? 
SPEAKER3 2:20:04
Passive perception? 
SPEAKER1 2:20:04
Passive perception? 
SPEAKER4 2:20:04
Passive perception? 
SPEAKER2 2:20:05
Passive perception? 
SPEAKER1 2:20:06
How about we tie the knot and leave it as an offering? 
SPEAKER3 2:20:10
Good idea. 
SPEAKER7 2:20:12
Honestly, I think they're trying to get us killed at this point. It seems very unlikely that somebody would be this dense in a place that nearly killed him. 
SPEAKER5 2:20:21
As you see it turn around, and then it also... Screams into the air. I need everyone to roll initiative. 
SPEAKER1 2:20:32
What is this, by the way? Can you? 
SPEAKER7 2:20:36
I think if you click your character sheet and then go to your left side where your icon is, it's all right underneath the picture. 
SPEAKER1 2:20:48
Damn, we fucking sucking sometime, but we ain't dying cause fuck that. 
SPEAKER4 2:20:57
Did I? How long has Mirage lasted? Does Ord still have haste? 
SPEAKER3 2:21:02
Ord at this point would still have haste. 
SPEAKER4 2:21:08
Thank god I used the sorcery point. They actually came in handy. 
SPEAKER5 2:21:11
I am hoping you moved relatively quickly. 
SPEAKER3 2:21:14
Cause then yes, Ord would still have haste. 
SPEAKER5 2:21:16
Janoon and Ord, roll initiative please. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:21
Alright. Nat fucking 20 baby. Oh no that's not mine. 
SPEAKER2 2:21:32
That's Mirage. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:33
Dirty 20 baby. 
SPEAKER3 2:21:36
Okay, as we begin combat with Fours at the top of the round. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:38
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on. You forgot my Davos. 
SPEAKER3 2:21:44
Uh, nope. They're in initiative as well. Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:48
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER5 2:21:51
You're getting control of them. 
SPEAKER3 2:21:53
But Fours, you're at the top of initiative. As you hear the first one scream out and then additional screams echo in the background as multiples of the creatures now wake up. 
SPEAKER2 2:22:02
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:03
Um. Okay. I'm going to slip past Dylan's stealth. Um. The two noisies. 
SPEAKER2 2:22:16
And. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:18
Are they coming from below my token? Or. 
SPEAKER3 2:22:21
They're coming from this direction. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:25
Oh, so they're coming from the south of me. 
SPEAKER3 2:22:27
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:28
Okay. Can I see them? 
SPEAKER5 2:22:30
Uh, if you're looking, you can see one. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:32
Okay. I'm going to shoot it. 
SPEAKER3 2:22:35
Um, right now it would have three quarters cover. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:41
I'm still going to shoot it. 
SPEAKER5 2:22:43
Cool. 
SPEAKER2 2:22:44
Go ahead. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:45
Uh. 
SPEAKER2 2:22:46
The previous roll has not completed. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:53
How do I? 
SPEAKER7 2:22:54
Uh, what's our arm? 
SPEAKER1 2:22:56
I think I did it. Maybe. Sixteen. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:02
All right. 
SPEAKER5 2:23:03
Sixteen. Let's see. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:05
I don't think it's going to hit. Yeah. Somehow I don't think it will, but I'm just going to check, you know. 
SPEAKER1 2:23:13
I probably not, but I'm still trying to figure out how the macros work. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:16
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 2:23:17
Any of you play by playing. I think you're an old lady and it's going to take me a minute. 
SPEAKER1 2:23:21
I mean, I drink tea and knit things. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:24
A 16 just barely does not. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:27
Fun. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:28
Cool. 
SPEAKER1 2:23:29
But I just chill behind my rock. I'm going to just chill behind my rock. All right. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:32
Um, for the record, entering the combat, I still had the hood up. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:33
That's still cool. 
SPEAKER1 2:23:34
That is still cool. Cool. Okay. Then next up. Ford, you're up. Which direction is this thing waking up from? Here. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:41
This direction. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:42
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:43
Was it down or left? Mm hmm. I think it's down. Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:47
I think it's down. 
SPEAKER4 2:23:48
Yeah. I think it's down. Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:51
I think it's down. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:52
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:53
I think it's down. Yeah. I think it's down. 
SPEAKER4 2:23:56
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:57
I think it's down. 
SPEAKER5 2:23:58
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:59
I think it's down. 
SPEAKER2 2:24:00
Yeah. Okay. Gotcha. I'm going to head down that way, see what I see. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:24:06
This area here, that little crevasse, because of the crystals, is difficult terrain. Justん be aware of that. 
SPEAKER2 2:24:14
Okay. That also is Dogaloo. Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 2:24:19
It's a haze. 
SPEAKER4 2:24:20
So, these creatures turn squeezed. 
SPEAKER2 2:24:22
Sorry. Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, or 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. All right. All right. Yeah, I can't see your... oh, I can see... oh, there's a... 
SPEAKER1 2:24:36
Yeah, they're trying to see you stick that. 
SPEAKER4 2:24:38
There's like... six lads in here. I'm gonna give a SWAT buckling. 
SPEAKER2 2:24:46
For whatever you city folk call it. And with my haste, I'm gonna do the... the thing. Alright. 
SPEAKER4 2:24:57
Oh, I like that. 
SPEAKER5 2:24:59
A 25 will hit. 
SPEAKER4 2:25:06
For... 19. 
SPEAKER3 2:25:09
Yeah, uh-huh, this one's down. Please describe how you absolutely rock this thing's world. 
SPEAKER4 2:25:14
Just right through the stomach, chubbin', you know. Except for, we're doing Darth Maul this minute, so this was one. 
SPEAKER3 2:25:25
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:25:26
Yes. 
SPEAKER4 2:25:27
Okay, that was a lot of movement. 
SPEAKER1 2:25:31
Wait, okay. 
SPEAKER4 2:25:32
Still have 15. 
SPEAKER2 2:25:33
Uh... I still have... 
SPEAKER4 2:25:36
Okay, I have 35, I used 45. And I have... I get like 30, so I have... 65, because of my traits, double that's 130, so I can, yeah, I can go up to this guy too and attack him as well. 
SPEAKER2 2:25:52
Okay, so I'm gonna do... 22. 22. 22. 
SPEAKER3 2:25:57
We'll also hit. 
SPEAKER5 2:25:58
Go ahead, go ahead. 
SPEAKER3 2:25:59
Yep. 
SPEAKER4 2:26:00
I just hear the sound of devastation. 
SPEAKER3 2:26:01
You just hear swords running, screaming, and the squelching sounds of death. 
SPEAKER2 2:26:06
Nine damage. 
SPEAKER3 2:26:07
Nine damage, this one is left standing. Very bloody. You basically cleave part of its stomach open. Yeah, that'll hit. Uh-huh, that'll do it. 
SPEAKER2 2:26:16
Yup. 
SPEAKER3 2:26:17
Okay, that's a good one. 
SPEAKER7 2:26:18
That's a good one. 
SPEAKER4 2:26:19
That's a good one. 
SPEAKER2 2:26:20
Yep. 
SPEAKER4 2:26:21
So, I'm gonna go off for 15. 
SPEAKER3 2:26:24
Yeah, you end this one as well. 
SPEAKER4 2:26:27
This one gets ended by like, full splattering, whatever that means. 
SPEAKER3 2:26:35
Good old splattering? Cool. 
SPEAKER2 2:26:37
Okay, so I was here 60, 65, 70, 80. 
SPEAKER4 2:26:43
So I have 5, 10, 15, 20, it's 100 over this guy, and I have one more attack. 
SPEAKER2 2:26:50
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 2:26:51
So, I'm gonna go off for 15. 
SPEAKER2 2:26:52
Oh, he's not even going to hit me. 
SPEAKER4 2:26:53
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 2:26:54
Where's the other button? Just shoot it. Uh, does the 14 hit? Yup. All right. That's how much? 
SPEAKER1 2:27:00
14. 
SPEAKER4 2:27:01
14 damage? Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:27:03
Yeah, you end this one as well. 
SPEAKER1 2:27:04
How are you gonna describe it? 
SPEAKER4 2:27:05
All right. 
SPEAKER3 2:27:06
This one is gonna be like, all right, we've been playing a beat and it's like, oh, I'm 
SPEAKER5 2:27:11
gonna get hit. 
SPEAKER4 2:27:12
Oh, I'm gonna get hit. 
SPEAKER3 2:27:13
It's like, oh, I'm gonna get hit. 
SPEAKER5 2:27:14
Oh, I'm gonna get hit. 
SPEAKER1 2:27:15
I'm gonna get hit. 
SPEAKER2 2:27:16
Oh, I'm gonna get hit. Oh, I'm gonna get hit. 
SPEAKER4 2:27:18
Oh, I'm gonna get hit. 
SPEAKER1 2:27:19
Oh, I'm gonna get hit. 
SPEAKER4 2:27:20
All right, we've been playing a beat saber. I got the horizontal and I got the vertical in this one. I'm going to ag. Across, like, a bandolier, where it just across, shoulder to hip. Ah. What the rest of you hear is a and then . Someone's playing a fucking Livana Polka level of beat saber in there. 
SPEAKER5 2:27:43
Yup. 
SPEAKER3 2:27:44
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 2:27:46
I thought, like, if we run out of energy for this turn, it's like, it's in there panting and just, like, just going to hit. Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 2:27:51
And then I'm just going to yell back, three more if you want to get in on it. I don't think anyone can actually make it in there before he fucking wrecks their shit. Hey, you never know. 
SPEAKER2 2:27:54
And then I have, I'm going to move back. 
SPEAKER1 2:27:55
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 2:27:56
You're going to move back? I can see the orb form. Beautiful. 
SPEAKER2 2:27:59
That's the end of your turn. 
SPEAKER5 2:28:00
Janoon, what are you up to? 
SPEAKER2 2:28:01
Yes. Janoon is going to turn Amitri in. Oh, we. Oh, we. 
SPEAKER3 2:28:05
Oh, we. 
SPEAKER1 2:28:06
Oh, we. 
SPEAKER2 2:28:07
Oh, we. Oh, we. 
SPEAKER4 2:28:09
Oh, we. 
SPEAKER3 2:28:10
Oh, we. 
SPEAKER5 2:28:11
Oh, we. 
SPEAKER3 2:28:12
Oh, we. 
SPEAKER2 2:28:13
Oh, we. Oh, we. 
SPEAKER1 2:28:15
Oh, we. Oh, we. Oh, we. Oh, we. 
SPEAKER3 2:28:19
Oh, we. 
SPEAKER1 2:28:20
Are we going to let them handle it because they woke them or what was the hell? I mean, there's not much we can do, we can't really kind of squeeze around anybody in this 
SPEAKER7 2:28:34
area but, um. 
SPEAKER1 2:28:35
You make a fair point. Uh, do you mind, you seem capable, do you mind perhaps carrying one of my mastiffs for me? Uh, yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:28:47
Oh, I'm glad to hear that. 
SPEAKER1 2:28:48
You know what, you make a good point. 
SPEAKER2 2:28:49
Uh, once again. I- I misjudged you. 
SPEAKER3 2:28:51
Uh. 
SPEAKER1 2:28:52
I'd misjudged you many times, you make very good points. Remind me, later. I- uh. 
SPEAKER2 2:28:55
Whatever. I'm rambling. 
SPEAKER1 2:28:57
Come here, boys. Come here, boys. 
SPEAKER2 2:28:59
What do you want? 
SPEAKER1 2:29:00
What do you want? Uh. Um, uh, uh. 
SPEAKER3 2:29:03
Come here. 
SPEAKER4 2:29:04
Come here. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:05
Come here. 
SPEAKER3 2:29:06
Come here. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:07
Uh. 
SPEAKER3 2:29:08
Come here. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:09
Come here. 
SPEAKER7 2:29:10
Come here. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:11
Come here. 
SPEAKER2 2:29:12
Uh. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:13
Uh. Uh. 
SPEAKER3 2:29:15
Uh. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:16
Come here boys! And he's just gonna have him- he's gonna grab his bag of holding and kind of extend it. There you go. Now get in! 
SPEAKER3 2:29:28
Both mastiffs do a leap into the bag itself. There are ten minutes of air in the bag. Because they are dogs, I mean I guess if a dog breathes the same amount of air as a person-ish, sort of. You have five minutes worth of time before they start to not have time. Simple enough. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:46
I'm just gonna go immediately down with my boys. And then let them out. 
SPEAKER7 2:29:51
Can she just leave the thing open since we're not actually in a combat situation? 
SPEAKER5 2:29:56
Oh no, you're an initiative. 
SPEAKER3 2:29:58
I mean, we're not actually contributing right now. No, but yes. So you begin your descent downwards. We'll get to that in a second. But if that's the only thing you're doing with the turn, I'll move it to the next one. 
SPEAKER1 2:30:08
Do I see them walking down the like- 
SPEAKER3 2:30:12
Yes. Cool. 
SPEAKER1 2:30:15
Can I ask a quick like kinda question? 
SPEAKER5 2:30:17
Just for- 
SPEAKER7 2:30:18
Uh huh. 
SPEAKER1 2:30:19
So, um, if you were to put like someone or something that breathes in a bag of holding and you just kinda like left it barely open, would that allow airflow while containing items? 
SPEAKER3 2:30:37
I'm going to say no. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:30:41
How does opening it quickly to allow air in work? So I know it's like a vacuum that'll suck air in, I guess, but like if you can't do that and have air come in and contents stay in, what about the quick opening it? 
SPEAKER3 2:30:56
You would have to open it as an action in order to have enough air go in to maintain breathing. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:31:02
I mean, my question is like, why does opening it quickly work but not leaving it just slightly barely open? 
SPEAKER5 2:31:11
Because I am the TM and that makes- 
SPEAKER4 2:31:12
Because I am the DM. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:13
Because I am the DM and that makes- that kind of breaks this item is the unfortunate answer. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 2:31:18
Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER7 2:31:20
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:21
Because the whole strategy of I'm going to sneak a party into a bank vault in a bag 
SPEAKER2 2:31:26
of holding. Yeah. I have an idea. 
SPEAKER7 2:31:29
Uh huh. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:30
That's for another time. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:31
That's for another time. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:32
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER5 2:31:33
Anyway. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:34
Genune, that is your turn. Moving on to the next turn. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:36
Ord, make a perception check. I'm not good at those. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:38
I'm not good at those. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:39
I'm not good at those. 
SPEAKER1 2:31:40
I'm not good at those. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:41
I'm not good at those. 
SPEAKER4 2:31:42
I'm not good at those. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:43
What did I say? Cool. 
SPEAKER4 2:31:45
I need to know. What are you highlighting over here, Denman? 
SPEAKER2 2:31:47
I'm scared. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:48
Does a 23 hit you? Yeah? 
SPEAKER2 2:31:50
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:51
You are grappled and restrained and you get reeled. 
SPEAKER4 2:31:52
How far away? Five, ten, fifteen. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:54
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:56
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER1 2:31:58
Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:59
Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER2 2:32:00
Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:01
Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER5 2:32:02
Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:03
Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:04
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:06
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER5 2:32:08
Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:09
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:11
Oh, oh. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:12
Oh, oh. Cool. They're dieser. 
SPEAKER5 2:32:15
They're easier involved. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:16
Okay. Thanks,aperant JEFF. How are you? Well, I returned to the experiment last weekend and didn't manage the modeling function due to not being able to wrap my head around a sensit guy. That's not nice at all. 
SPEAKER4 2:32:42
Wait. the thing. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:48
No. 
SPEAKER4 2:32:50
I can see in dark. 
SPEAKER5 2:32:53
Oh yeah, but it has literally 
SPEAKER3 2:32:54
a feature called false appearance. While it remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from normal cave formation. 
SPEAKER7 2:33:01
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:33:02
You don't have the alert feed. Sorry. This is a surprise round. I also need to know, as the last part of its multi-attack against you, does a 25 hit? 
SPEAKER2 2:33:10
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 2:33:13
I need you to take 18 points of 
SPEAKER3 2:33:15
piercing damage. 
SPEAKER4 2:33:18
Oh no, it gets tapped. 
SPEAKER5 2:33:19
Are you still raging? 
SPEAKER2 2:33:22
Yes, I rage at your combat. 
SPEAKER5 2:33:23
Look up. You rage at the beginning of this combat? 
SPEAKER1 2:33:27
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:33:27
How many rages do you have left after this one? 
SPEAKER2 2:33:29
I have... 
SPEAKER4 2:33:32
This is my last one. 
SPEAKER6 2:33:34
Alright. 
SPEAKER3 2:33:35
Make sure you're tracking that. Take 9 points of piercing damage then. 
SPEAKER2 2:33:40
Sir. 
SPEAKER3 2:33:43
As 
SPEAKER2 2:33:44
now 
SPEAKER3 2:33:45
the familiar form of another 
SPEAKER4 2:33:49
roper is brought forward. 
SPEAKER3 2:33:52
Yes. 
SPEAKER4 2:33:53
Does the temporary HP 
SPEAKER3 2:33:55
go away first? Mm-hmm. And, as you are reeled in and realize what is going on, the other stalagmite that you notice when you're around the other creature 
SPEAKER2 2:34:12
also awakens to another roper. 
SPEAKER5 2:34:22
Anyway. 
SPEAKER3 2:34:23
That's that one's turn. The Mastiff's turn of bags, so no turn there. Next Grimlock. This one's going to move. 5, 10, 15, 
SPEAKER7 2:34:34
20, 
SPEAKER3 2:34:35
25. Up to you. 
SPEAKER2 2:34:40
And you're gonna need to do a little more damage. 
SPEAKER3 2:34:42
Because you were the one who killed its associate. And it is also going to hit you with its spiked bone club. It's not very nice, is it? Does a 24 hit? 
SPEAKER2 2:34:54
Yup. 
SPEAKER7 2:34:55
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 2:34:56
And we need to take 9 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage, halved. 
SPEAKER7 2:35:01
So, are both jizzard and a... 
SPEAKER2 2:35:05
Or just being completely silent during this time? 
SPEAKER1 2:35:09
I'm not saying what's going on. 
SPEAKER2 2:35:10
I'm like just... 
SPEAKER6 2:35:11
I've been shouting at you guys. 
SPEAKER4 2:35:13
There's three of them left in here. If you want to come help me. 
SPEAKER2 2:35:15
Yup. 
SPEAKER3 2:35:16
And then jizzard, what are you shouting as you're watching this happen? 
SPEAKER4 2:35:20
I can't see shit. I just hear stuff. 
SPEAKER3 2:35:23
As you hear all of this happen, are you saying anything? Are you just sitting around? 
SPEAKER2 2:35:27
Sounds like... Having a... 
SPEAKER1 2:35:30
A time. 
SPEAKER2 2:35:32
A time? 
SPEAKER7 2:35:33
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 2:35:35
First good, then bad. 
SPEAKER7 2:35:38
Okay. So... Is it like time that matters or just time that he's just doing okay? 
SPEAKER4 2:35:44
I mean, he's alone in there right now. 
SPEAKER1 2:35:46
Having a... 
SPEAKER4 2:35:47
What last I heard was a bad time. 
SPEAKER1 2:35:52
So you started a bad time and like what sort of bad time are we talking about? 
SPEAKER7 2:35:55
Are you talking about serious bad time? 
SPEAKER4 2:35:57
He's getting fucked up. I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 2:35:59
I can't tell you what's going on. 
SPEAKER3 2:36:00
Which brings us to Michi's turn. 
SPEAKER4 2:36:01
I'm not in there. 
SPEAKER3 2:36:02
What are you up to, Michi? 
SPEAKER7 2:36:04
I can't hear you with that. What was it? 
SPEAKER2 2:36:06
It's up to your turn. 
SPEAKER3 2:36:07
What are you up to? I'm not in there. 
SPEAKER1 2:36:09
Can you describe what the fuck's going on there, Jizzard? So... 
SPEAKER7 2:36:15
More than just he's fucking having a time? 
SPEAKER2 2:36:17
I'm... 
SPEAKER4 2:36:18
I know as much as you do right now. He killed a thing and then moved out of sight. 
SPEAKER3 2:36:23
My gosh. 
SPEAKER4 2:36:25
Guys, should we save him? 
SPEAKER7 2:36:28
Quickly? 
SPEAKER5 2:36:29
Quickly? 
SPEAKER7 2:36:30
Response? 
SPEAKER3 2:36:32
I'mma move over so we're fucking, uh... So I can actually peer down the fucking hallway. 
SPEAKER2 2:36:42
Moving past you as you're pushing. 
SPEAKER1 2:36:44
Can I see down this hallway, Devon? 
SPEAKER3 2:36:46
Yes, you can see everything that is highlighted in your vision space. 
SPEAKER1 2:36:49
Which... 
SPEAKER5 2:36:50
Oh, so I can actually see him getting fucking... Yeah, now as you move over and see, especially with your range vision, two things. 
SPEAKER3 2:36:55
You understand why Jizzard couldn't see. Or it is far. The second thing is you see two corpses. Both of them the same creatures as earlier. You see a third creature, this time alive. And you see right next to it, in the jaws of yet another creature, a corpse. And you see right next to it, in the jaws of yet another creature, a corpse. And you see right next to it, in the jaws of yet another creature, a corpse. And you see right next to it, in the jaws of yet another creature, a corpse. The first thing you see in the jaws of yet another roper, another Slagmite with a burning red eye, with tentacles whipping around, and the figure of Ord bloodied to hell in its grip, being wailed on by both of them. 
SPEAKER7 2:37:20
I mean, she's gonna put a hand her fucking head. 
SPEAKER1 2:37:26
Oh, Jesus Christ. 
SPEAKER7 2:37:27
That thing from earlier that was Jizzard trying to save, again, another one. We must, I guess, as she inches closer to trying to get in there and save him. 
SPEAKER3 2:37:36
I guess, as she inches closer to trying to get in there and save him. 
SPEAKER7 2:37:37
I guess, as she inches closer to trying to get in there and save him. 
SPEAKER3 2:37:38
Okay, realize that this area here is difficult terrain. So I'll stop. 
SPEAKER7 2:37:44
I move 15 the first time, so I can only move another 5 feet, I think. 
SPEAKER3 2:37:48
Um, it's... Like right here? Yep. Come on, guys! 
SPEAKER7 2:37:54
The things I do for love, she exclaims. A lot. 
SPEAKER4 2:37:59
For love? 
SPEAKER7 2:38:01
It's a courage card, you know, the long joke. I get it. 
SPEAKER3 2:38:05
Oh, yeah. Okay, anything else on your turn? 
SPEAKER7 2:38:10
Uh, let me see my distance. That's 40 feet. 
SPEAKER2 2:38:17
Uh, you know, I think Toll the Dead is about that range. 
SPEAKER3 2:38:22
So we're going to cast and make sure. 
SPEAKER7 2:38:28
60 feet, I'm gonna Toll the Dead this fucking thing. 
SPEAKER2 2:38:33
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 2:38:35
Go ahead. 
SPEAKER3 2:38:36
Okay. Go ahead. As it rings out again, a familiar sound of pain. 
SPEAKER2 2:38:47
Uh, does it... 
SPEAKER3 2:38:53
Oh, that's my damage roll. 
SPEAKER7 2:38:59
Where is my actual roll? 
SPEAKER3 2:39:01
Toll the Dead is not a roll to hit. Okay, then. It's just not a hit. 
SPEAKER7 2:39:06
I guess it's a 15 then, for damage. 
SPEAKER3 2:39:09
Uh, I need to make a wisdom saving throw. 
SPEAKER5 2:39:12
And you're hitting the Roper again? 
SPEAKER7 2:39:14
Yeah. Uh, it's supposed to be a 1d12. Why does it say 2d8 plus 2d12? Yeah, it's not cast at a high level, so I'm gonna read it as a 1d12. Sorry. 
SPEAKER3 2:39:27
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:39:28
And this roll is a 15. Okay. So I'm gonna go ahead and cast it. I'm gonna go ahead and cast it. I'm gonna go ahead and cast it. I'm gonna go ahead and cast it. 
SPEAKER3 2:39:34
And this Roper has taken no damage, so it is a 1d8, actually. 
SPEAKER7 2:39:38
Uh, plus my... Oh, it's a 1d8. 
SPEAKER3 2:39:40
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER7 2:39:41
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:39:42
Well, either way, that was a 4 on top of whatever Toll the Dead actually is supposed to do on top of that. So, whatever you want to do with that one. 
SPEAKER3 2:39:52
So I'll take the 4, and then what is your saving throw that I have to beat to try and take half the damage? 
SPEAKER7 2:39:56
Uh, spell saving C is 14. 
SPEAKER3 2:39:58
Okay, cool. It takes all four of those hit points. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:02
All right. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:05
As a bell rings out into the cavern, alerting whatever else might be there, you do not know. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:11
Okay. That's the end of your turn. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:14
Yeah. Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:16
That's the end. 
SPEAKER7 2:40:17
Insanhan, you're up. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:18
All right. Um... 
SPEAKER2 2:40:20
Let me see. 
SPEAKER1 2:40:21
Oh. Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:23
Insanhan will kind of quickly run out to here. 
SPEAKER1 2:40:24
Um... 
SPEAKER5 2:40:25
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:40:26
So, I'm gonna go ahead and cast the spell. Okay. So, I'm gonna go ahead and cast the spell. Okay. So, I'm gonna go ahead and cast the spell. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:31
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:40:32
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:33
Okay. 
SPEAKER7 2:40:34
So, I'm gonna go ahead and cast the spell. All right. 
SPEAKER1 2:40:36
And then I'll go ahead and cast the spell. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:37
This is a pretty good question. 
SPEAKER1 2:40:38
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:39
So, as I said, I'm not sure if I'm doing okay. 
SPEAKER7 2:40:40
Um... 
SPEAKER1 2:40:41
Okay. I think I do want to go ahead and cast the spell. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:44
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:45
I think I do want to go ahead and cast the spell. 
SPEAKER1 2:40:46
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 2:40:47
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 2:40:48
So, I don't have any other options. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:49
I don't have any other options. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:50
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:51
Okay. So, if you put your spell on, your card will roll. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:53
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:54
So, I'm not sure if I can do anything. 
SPEAKER1 2:40:55
Um... Uh... Oh. That's not a problem. That's not a problem. 
SPEAKER4 2:41:00
can kind of see right up until here yeah i can't really can't really see where uh word is so he's just gonna kind of run out and still being a bit cautious just kind of wait to see what michi's

SPEAKER7 2:45:16
superior related answering question which means they're a affected by stoner okay the first one has a 16. uh let me make sure i think that's a fail though because it's supposed to be let me double check 
SPEAKER1 2:45:36
what does that say there within 30 feet you must succeed in one minute they'll be charmed blah blah 
SPEAKER7 2:45:42
blah if they do it's a magic save plus proficiency plus constitution on fire so spill save is d14 or 14 and then i said what proficiency plus three 
SPEAKER3 2:45:57
so it's 17 plus my constitution modifier which is where the is my constitution so it's the um the saving throw is eight plus your proficiency bonus plus your con modifier okay so then it's 11 plus my common where's my constitution constitution sorry we have a hard time reading this that's okay we know you can't read i am you know it's a struggle of life 
SPEAKER7 2:46:28
constitution is plus five oh no that's my saving throws 
SPEAKER1 2:46:32
you can read my just dang look forward 
SPEAKER3 2:46:37

SPEAKER2 2:46:47
fails okay okay 
SPEAKER7 2:46:49

SPEAKER2 2:46:56
they won't attack at all they cannot move they cannot attack 
SPEAKER7 2:47:04
they are incapacitated 
SPEAKER5 2:47:08
okay cool 
SPEAKER1 2:47:10

SPEAKER3 2:47:15
let me get the rights 
SPEAKER2 2:47:19
so i'm going to use the other roper's turn 
SPEAKER3 2:47:22
so it's 80 plus proficiency so it's 11 cool all right which brings us to what the return is actually on the other roper's turn it is going to use its multi-attack um i need to know it makesności four attacks so let's do this on one of these that's gonna miss michi i'm gonna need to know 
SPEAKER7 2:48:02
does a 27 hit you yeah cool 
SPEAKER3 2:48:07
and then 24. cool so michi uh you get hit with a tendril out of the side of the darkness you see another side of sort of creature begin to move another one of the other things you see is the creature begin to move another rock formation move as a tentacle shoots out to you and grabs 
SPEAKER5 2:48:23
around your leg you are then reeled all the way how many how far can it reel 25 feet hold on a 
SPEAKER7 2:48:30
second i believe this one goes with another ability to second one second you do your thing and i'll see if it's true or not 20 25 you see one of the creatures get reeled 
SPEAKER3 2:48:44
along with you but five ten fifteen 20 25. yoinked and then it is going to use its bite attack on one of the creatures that you are fighting but it is going to miss and that is unfortunate which brings us back to 
SPEAKER7 2:49:08

SPEAKER5 2:57:47
Then on its not end of its turn, it is going to

Yes. 
SPEAKER3 2:58:06
Cool. 
SPEAKER1 2:58:08
You are grappled 
SPEAKER3 2:58:09
and restrained. 
SPEAKER7 2:58:10
Can I ask a question on that? 
SPEAKER3 2:58:14
Yes. 
SPEAKER7 2:58:14
So grappling, that requires a strength saving throw, right? 
SPEAKER3 2:58:18
No. To break out of it, 
SPEAKER2 2:58:21
it is a strength saving throw. 
SPEAKER7 2:58:23
Oh, so only if it's holding then. 
SPEAKER5 2:58:25
Yes, so once you're grappled, 
SPEAKER3 2:58:27
it is a strength saving throw to break out of it. 
SPEAKER7 2:58:31
Okay, that's what I wanted to make sure. 
SPEAKER4 2:58:33
I'll keep that in mind. Oh, I see. 
SPEAKER1 2:58:38

So, apparently someone from high school just called. They found my name on a random piece of paper. Interesting. Um, anyway. Apparently we played Xbox a while ago. I guess. For Cutco Knives. Um, well, you guys asked for more combat and I said I'd just sprinkle more monsters in every time you guys said something stupid. 
SPEAKER5 3:01:00
So, anyway. It is the roper's turn. Uh, Jizzard, you are grappled and restrained. It is going to reel you 25 feet in. 
SPEAKER3 3:01:07
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 3:01:08
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 3:01:09
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 3:01:09
So, that's 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. 
SPEAKER4 3:01:15
Oh, my God. 
SPEAKER5 3:01:16
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 3:01:17
Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER2 3:01:17
This is a wide open space. 
SPEAKER5 3:01:20
Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER4 3:01:20
Jesus. 
SPEAKER1 3:01:21
Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER7 3:01:22
Welcome to the shit show there, buddy. 
SPEAKER5 3:01:24
Um, it will also... 
SPEAKER7 3:01:26
There isn't a lot for it to attack. 
SPEAKER2 3:01:29
Um... 
SPEAKER1 3:01:30
Wait, did we skip Saga? 
SPEAKER3 3:01:32
No. 
SPEAKER1 3:01:33
No. 
SPEAKER3 3:01:34
No, she's up next. 
SPEAKER1 3:01:36
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER3 3:01:37
Oh, he's up next, rather. Let me get my genders right. 
SPEAKER5 3:01:41
Um, it is also going to tendril attack 
SPEAKER3 3:01:43
one of the other Grimlocks. Cool, cool, cool. 
SPEAKER5 3:01:47
That is an 11. 
SPEAKER3 3:01:49
Uh, which will not hit. 
SPEAKER5 3:01:51
God damn it. And then it's going to use its bite attack on Ord. 
SPEAKER3 3:01:59
Hey, Ord. 
SPEAKER6 3:02:01
Hi. 
SPEAKER5 3:02:02
Does a 23 hit? 
SPEAKER1 3:02:05
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 3:02:07
Well, here's the good news. 
SPEAKER3 3:02:09
You get to have the damage. 
SPEAKER1 3:02:12
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 3:02:13
The bad news is it's 24 damage. 
SPEAKER4 3:02:16
Yeah, Ord's down. 
SPEAKER1 3:02:18
No! 
SPEAKER5 3:02:19
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 3:02:22
Ord is now unconscious. Fine. Well, that's good. Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 3:02:34
Do-do-do-do. 
SPEAKER3 3:02:37
Where is unconscious? There we go. Ord is now unconscious. With that, that's the end of its turn. It will make a wisdom saving throw. 
SPEAKER5 3:02:48
Do-do-do-do. 
SPEAKER3 3:02:49
Roll a seven. 
SPEAKER7 3:02:52
And it's incapacitated. 
SPEAKER5 3:02:53
And the rope is incapacitated as well. 
SPEAKER6 3:02:56
Cool. 
SPEAKER5 3:02:58
Do we get to reroll at the end of our turns? 
SPEAKER7 3:03:01
Uh, you have to do it each time. So, yeah. 
SPEAKER5 3:03:04
Yeah, reroll at the end of each turn. 
SPEAKER3 3:03:05
Cool. 
SPEAKER7 3:03:06
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 3:03:06
Yep. 
SPEAKER3 3:03:07
And, Sanhan, you're up. 
SPEAKER5 3:03:10
You've now seen two people ahead of you get yoinked into the room. And you can see from where you're at. 
SPEAKER3 3:03:16
Um, because you have a dark vision of 60 feet, right? 
SPEAKER1 3:03:21
Um, I think we decided Sanhan didn't have dark vision somewhat recently. Like, we thought he did up until recently. 
SPEAKER3 3:03:31
And then it was ruled that he didn't because it's not on the character sheet. 
SPEAKER1 3:03:36
That's where Kinko's head is. Yeah. That's what I thought. But I couldn't find it online. I don't know. But this whole time we've been playing previously as if he had it. Kinko's head has dark vision of 60 feet. Oh, okay. How's he able to find it? Oh, well. Anyways. Uh, yeah. Anyways. 
SPEAKER3 3:03:58
He's going to... Then what you see is a dead and dying orb in front of you. 
SPEAKER6 3:04:03
Wait. 
SPEAKER7 3:04:03
A grappled jizzard. 
SPEAKER3 3:04:05
Which I can actually put on the effect. 
SPEAKER6 3:04:07
Now. 
SPEAKER1 3:04:07
Haha. Uh, wait. That might be wrong. 
SPEAKER7 3:04:14
Uh, I'm probably going to piss somebody off. But I ran right over back this room. It works on a creature and it's the root that I chose in front of me. It's not all creatures. 
SPEAKER3 3:04:26
Beautiful. That's beautiful. 
SPEAKER5 3:04:33
Thank you. 
SPEAKER1 3:04:34
Sure. 
SPEAKER3 3:04:37
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 3:04:39
But in Sanhan, what you can see in front of you is a grappled jizzard on the ground. 
SPEAKER3 3:04:43
Um, a, another creature standing over him. And on the other side, a unconscious, limp, bloodied orb being flung in the air by a roper. Getting ready to make it a final meal. 
SPEAKER1 3:04:58
And does the roper look at all injured? 
SPEAKER7 3:05:03
Not really. 
SPEAKER3 3:05:05
It looks like... Not really. It looks like a regular old roper. Like the first thing you saw and the first one you run into. 
SPEAKER1 3:05:12
Oh, fun. Um. 
SPEAKER6 3:05:20
Hmm. 
SPEAKER1 3:05:21
I. Will say. God, it. I could cast fireball. I shouldn't. But I could. Sorry. 
SPEAKER6 3:05:37
Um. 
SPEAKER1 3:05:38
That would be very tempting. Um. That would be so funny. But I don't want to just kill everyone in there. I will do... I will quickly... Let's see. It's a... I guess... 
SPEAKER3 3:05:56
Sorry, I'm trying to see the range on Tasha's mind whip. 
SPEAKER1 3:06:01
Fuck that. I can't find it. I'm doing shatter. Uh, Isakhan will step... Step. 
SPEAKER2 3:06:06
Into... 
SPEAKER3 3:06:07
Into... 
SPEAKER1 3:06:08
I think he's within about... 
SPEAKER7 3:06:13
Oh my god. 
SPEAKER1 3:06:13
Okay, sorry. 
SPEAKER7 3:06:14
Sorry. 
SPEAKER1 3:06:15
My thing freaked out on me. Uh, I will kind of move him. To... Each square is five feet, right? 
SPEAKER3 3:06:19
Uh, except for the ones in this area. 
SPEAKER1 3:06:20
In this area here. They are difficult terrains. They are ten feet. 
SPEAKER3 3:06:23
Oh, okay. Oh, he started here. Okay, so... Yeah, he can... Yeah, he can... Yeah, he can... 
SPEAKER1 3:06:29
Yeah, he can... 
SPEAKER3 3:06:30
Yeah, he can... Yeah, he can... 
SPEAKER1 3:06:32
Yeah, he can... Yeah, he can... Yeah, he can... 
SPEAKER3 3:06:35
Yeah, he can... 
SPEAKER2 3:06:36
He can move about there. 
SPEAKER3 3:06:37
He can move about there. 
SPEAKER1 3:06:38
So he will move to the end of that corridor and cast shatter on the... One second, let me get this. Uh, on... Did it... 
SPEAKER3 3:06:53
Did it do it? 
SPEAKER7 3:06:54
Did it cast shatter? 
SPEAKER1 3:06:55
Did it cast shatter? 
SPEAKER3 3:06:56
Um... 
SPEAKER1 3:06:57
So read me the spell effects for恕 really quick. 
SPEAKER5 3:07:00
Um, let's see. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:01
Each creature is... Each creature is... 
SPEAKER1 3:07:03
Each creature is... 
SPEAKER3 3:07:04
Each creature is... 
SPEAKER1 3:07:05
Each creature is... Agile from, from one specific point in time. You get half the rate from any four Elder mana item. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:11
Sure. 
SPEAKER1 3:07:12
Proud Brite from this character. Attack and heal. Nice. Okay, so, you take on yourself a card attack from the north, um, now you have four power. Okay. Fine. Cool. So now, when you gain power, you can move into that hill. And then now, even under that hill, 
SPEAKER7 3:07:28
you can add two powerо A Star papier. Okay, I can, you can causae spell damage... 
SPEAKER3 3:07:31
Dejuice, Poe. ... 
SPEAKER5 3:07:33
Energy. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:34
yeah, that's worth that. 
SPEAKER1 3:07:35
Yep. 
SPEAKER5 3:07:38
Let's see what a 10-foot radius looks like. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:46
Okay, 10-foot. So Ord will be in this blast. 
SPEAKER7 3:07:52
It's fine. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:54
Ord cannot make a saving throw. It is an automatic failure. This roper will take an automatic disadvantage because it is made of stone. 
SPEAKER5 3:08:05
So constitution saving throw. 
SPEAKER3 3:08:07
Cool. 
SPEAKER1 3:08:10
Rolled terribly. That is a 4 and a 5. Has Ord failed a death save yet? 
SPEAKER5 3:08:14
Nope. 
SPEAKER3 3:08:16
He'll be fine. This will count as a failed death save. Or two. 
SPEAKER1 3:08:25
Let's go with one. You said one first. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:08:31
Yeah, damage received at 0H3 results in a failure. So a failure. So go ahead and roll damage. 
SPEAKER5 3:08:40
3d8. 
SPEAKER1 3:08:41
Okay. 3d8. I do roll slash roll. 
SPEAKER6 3:08:48
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER7 3:08:50
Roll. 
SPEAKER3 3:08:51
I probably changed music away from, like, you know, just your basic ass. 
SPEAKER6 3:08:56
Yeah. No. 
SPEAKER2 3:08:56
Ambiance. 
SPEAKER7 3:08:57
Ambiance. 
SPEAKER6 3:08:59
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:08:59
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 3:09:03
Haha. 
SPEAKER6 3:09:05
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:06
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER6 3:09:06
Damn. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:06
3d8 only got 10 damage. 
SPEAKER5 3:09:10
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 3:09:10
Killing Ord to get 10 damage. 
SPEAKER5 3:09:13
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:14
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER5 3:09:14
Ord take one fail death save. 
SPEAKER6 3:09:16
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 3:09:17
Looks like I was wrong. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:21
You do not have dark vision. 
SPEAKER1 3:09:22
I'm reading in Velo's guide. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:26
Fuck it. She can see for the moment. 
SPEAKER4 3:09:31
Well, you can see because Gizzard's illuminating, like, the entire cast. 
SPEAKER1 3:09:36
Oh, yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:36
Because you have light cast on you, don't you? 
SPEAKER1 3:09:38
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 3:09:38
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:39
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 3:09:39
Because Gizzard can't see. 
SPEAKER5 3:09:41
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:41
Exactly. 
SPEAKER5 3:09:42
So 10 damage. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:43
Ord, you take an additional fail death save. Cool. 
SPEAKER5 3:09:46
And Songhong, anything else on your turn? 
SPEAKER4 3:09:48
You have your movement and you've used your reaction. 
SPEAKER1 3:09:53
He's just going to hope for the best. 
SPEAKER4 3:09:56
I think he can only take one fail death save. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:59
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 3:09:59
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:10:01
So right now, he should have one fail death save before it's even his turn. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 3:10:06
Actually, he'll just react. He'll just, like, kind of go, like, as he notices Ord was actually just on the edge of that, and he'll kind of cringe. 
SPEAKER3 3:10:15
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 3:10:16
Just like, ooh. 
SPEAKER5 3:10:17
Hey, Gizzard. 
SPEAKER3 3:10:18
You're up. 
SPEAKER4 3:10:19
I will do a chill touch. 
SPEAKER1 3:10:31
Extend my black glove hand. 
SPEAKER4 3:10:33
Oh, my god. And reach at the roper that has me roped. 
SPEAKER3 3:10:39
This one. 
SPEAKER2 3:10:40
Mm-hmm. And ice his ass. 
SPEAKER4 3:10:42
I have to roll the ball. Does a 21 hit? 21 does hit, yeah. 
SPEAKER2 3:10:56
Okay. I do 6 damage. 
SPEAKER4 3:11:02
Necrotic damage. Necrotic damage. And I cannot heal until the start of my next turn. I didn't know that was a feature until I read it. Yep. 
SPEAKER2 3:11:13
But it's a feature, not a bug. 
SPEAKER3 3:11:16
It's a feature, not a bug. Okay, cool. You're a Grappler in Restraint, so you do not have a movement. Nope. Anything on your bonus action? 
SPEAKER4 3:11:23
I don't think I can do anything. Wait, wait. I had a funky potion, right? 
SPEAKER5 3:11:32
Did you? 
SPEAKER1 3:11:33
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 3:11:34
I picked it up from the bag from the dead lady that wasn't such a lady. 
SPEAKER3 3:11:41
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 3:11:42
But you don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. 
SPEAKER4 3:11:44
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 3:11:45
But I'll drink it. Oh, are you sure you want to do that? 
SPEAKER3 3:11:52
I'm very sure. 
SPEAKER5 3:11:54
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 3:11:55
As you begin to uncork the bottle, it writhes in your hand. I cannot heal. 
SPEAKER7 3:12:01
I'm so sorry. 
SPEAKER3 3:12:02
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER2 3:12:03
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 3:12:04
The glass that should have been solid becomes supple and flesh-like as a small child mimic now grasps onto your hand that was holding the bottle. 
SPEAKER1 3:12:17
What? That's a child mimic. 
SPEAKER5 3:12:22
Mimic that is a child. 
SPEAKER4 3:12:27
Alright. 
SPEAKER1 3:12:30
You know what? 
SPEAKER2 3:12:34
Cool. 
SPEAKER5 3:12:38
And it will join initiative. And we'll see what it does afterwards. 
SPEAKER7 3:12:49
Cool. 
SPEAKER4 3:12:50
I can't contribute much anyway. 
SPEAKER5 3:12:53
From there, it is Grimlock's turn. 
SPEAKER1 3:12:56
Cool. 
SPEAKER5 3:12:58
It is going to go ahead and swipe at Michi as you were so very, very wonderfully delivered to him. 
SPEAKER3 3:13:04
I will need to know, does a 12 hit? Not close, buddy. 
SPEAKER5 3:13:10
Not close. 
SPEAKER3 3:13:10
Damn. 
SPEAKER5 3:13:11
You've been dragged. 
SPEAKER3 3:13:13
You've been grappled and dragged into this room. And then you see this thing take its initiative and try and just swipe down at you as you were dragged into its space and whiff. Terribly. And that is its turn. 
SPEAKER1 3:13:31
Wait, who pulled me? 
SPEAKER2 3:13:32
Um. 
SPEAKER6 3:13:33
Um. 
SPEAKER3 3:13:34
The other roper. 
SPEAKER7 3:13:35
When you first got pulled into this room. 
SPEAKER1 3:13:36
The one that's incapacitated? 
SPEAKER3 3:13:37
Yes, it is still. 
SPEAKER5 3:13:37
It is incapacitated now. 
SPEAKER3 3:13:40
Oh. But because we got pulled into the Grimlock's combat space. 
SPEAKER7 3:13:44
You just kind of confused me. I get it now. 
SPEAKER6 3:13:46
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:13:47
For the mimic's turn. 
SPEAKER6 3:13:48
Um. 
SPEAKER3 3:13:49
Jizzard. 
SPEAKER5 3:13:49
I need to know if. Do, do, do, do. 
SPEAKER3 3:13:57
Uh. 
SPEAKER5 3:13:57
Does a 12 hit? 
SPEAKER3 3:13:58
It doesn't. 
SPEAKER7 3:13:59
Damn. 
SPEAKER1 3:13:59
No. Cool. 
SPEAKER5 3:14:01
As it tries to whip out like a small. 
SPEAKER3 3:14:03
Its own small. Small pseudoped and try to hear you, but it doesn't have great aim. It only has six eyes and it hits the ground in front of your face. As this writhing mimic potion bottle just vibrates in space. 
SPEAKER1 3:14:18
It's a bottle size mimic? 
SPEAKER5 3:14:20
Yes. 
SPEAKER4 3:14:21
So like the teeth is like a little potion hole. 
SPEAKER6 3:14:23
Mm hmm. 
SPEAKER4 3:14:25
Oh, this thing's cute. 
SPEAKER5 3:14:26
Yeah. It'll still kill you though. 
SPEAKER1 3:14:29
I mean. 
SPEAKER4 3:14:31
I guess. 
SPEAKER5 3:14:32
Which brings us to Michi. 
SPEAKER6 3:14:33
Michi. 
SPEAKER5 3:14:33
You're up. 
SPEAKER7 3:14:37
Jesus Christ. I really got to figure that stupid sound out. All right. All right. 
SPEAKER3 3:14:43
Michi. 
SPEAKER1 3:14:44
Is going to uncork a bottle from their fucking inventory. 
SPEAKER6 3:14:48
Mm hmm. 
SPEAKER7 3:14:48
It takes a nice big swig of a beautiful fire breath potion. 
SPEAKER6 3:14:54
Mm hmm. 
SPEAKER2 3:14:55
First time. 
SPEAKER3 3:14:57
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 3:14:58
And I'm going to look over to Jizzard. 
SPEAKER1 3:15:01
And then back at fucking Ord. And from my angle. 
SPEAKER7 3:15:05
Let's see. 
SPEAKER1 3:15:06
What is the distance on that shit again? 
SPEAKER7 3:15:08
Because I don't have the exact stats for it. 
SPEAKER3 3:15:10
It gives you a potion of dragon's breath, right? 
SPEAKER2 3:15:13
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 3:15:14
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:15:14
It is a 15 foot cone. 
SPEAKER5 3:15:16
Just it's right. 
SPEAKER4 3:15:18
I have two spells that do the exact same thing. 
SPEAKER7 3:15:22
I can kind of miss Ord from this direction. 
SPEAKER6 3:15:24
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 3:15:25
Yeah. It doesn't look like he's in the circle. Or that. 
SPEAKER3 3:15:29
Wait, hold on. Measure. Measure your 15 foot cone. Show me your 15 foot cone. 
SPEAKER7 3:15:33
So 15 is from the broker to me, but it's not in it. 
SPEAKER3 3:15:38
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 3:15:39
So there's a cone measurement tool that I'm using. 
SPEAKER3 3:15:42
Right. So if you go into measurements, there's a rectangular, there's a circle, and then there's a cone template. 
SPEAKER2 3:15:49
I don't see that. 
SPEAKER4 3:15:52
It's a little like protractor looking thing on the left. 
SPEAKER7 3:15:54
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:15:54
So the measurement. 
SPEAKER7 3:15:55
Oh, now it can now change. Mm hmm. 
SPEAKER3 3:15:58
Then 15. 
SPEAKER1 3:16:01
It kind of looks like it hits it. Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 3:16:03
So it's not going to hit the roper. 
SPEAKER3 3:16:04
That's that does not look like it's going to hit the Roper. 
SPEAKER7 3:16:11
No, I can hit this one. 
SPEAKER1 3:16:12
It's still incapacitated. 
SPEAKER3 3:16:15
That one's also no, that's that's. 
SPEAKER4 3:16:17
That was longer than 15 feet, right? 
SPEAKER1 3:16:20
15 feet right there to the right. 
SPEAKER3 3:16:23
Wait, can you see the measurement that I put down? 
SPEAKER4 3:16:28
Yeah, because you were like that. 
SPEAKER1 3:16:30
Yeah, mine says 15 when I look out distance. Are you doing it from dead center? 
SPEAKER3 3:16:33
Yeah, dead center where your token is. 
SPEAKER7 3:16:35
Oh, okay. So I figured it would be a little distance. Can you remove those, please? 
SPEAKER2 3:16:40
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:16:40
It's like fucking, I don't know. 
SPEAKER2 3:16:42
I don't know how to get rid of it. 
SPEAKER5 3:16:44
Jizzer, you're fireproof, right? 
SPEAKER1 3:16:46
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:16:48
I'm going to blow my fucking load all over Jizzer there. Somebody quote that. 
SPEAKER1 3:16:54
All right, go ahead. 
SPEAKER5 3:16:56
Aim your fucking little mimic over here, you little shit. 
SPEAKER1 3:16:58
Put it on the right side of you. 
SPEAKER7 3:17:00
I'm going to put it on the left side of you. 
SPEAKER3 3:17:02
I'm going to put it on the right side of you. 
SPEAKER7 3:17:03
Closer to me, not away from you, Douglas. 
SPEAKER3 3:17:06
Jizzer, I will give you the opportunity because of all of this to try and move the mimic as it is small. 
SPEAKER4 3:17:17
I'll just fucking like kind of give it like a light kick with my foot because it's just rolling around as a little potion bottle. 
SPEAKER2 3:17:25
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 3:17:26
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 3:17:27
Just fucking like give it a little tap. 
SPEAKER3 3:17:28
A little tap tap. 
SPEAKER1 3:17:30
And then it'll go. Beep, beep, beep, beep. Beep, beep, beep, beep. 
SPEAKER3 3:17:33
I will say it gets moved here. Yeah, I'm going to aim it towards Jizzer so it doesn't hit a ward. 
SPEAKER2 3:17:35
Okay. Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 3:17:37
I can take it. 
SPEAKER3 3:17:38
I'm a big boy. I'm a big fireproof boy. 
SPEAKER2 3:17:40
And with that, that is my primary action. 
SPEAKER4 3:17:41
Now I got to get it back to my fucking character. Okay. Go ahead and roll damage. 
SPEAKER3 3:17:44
Ooh. 
SPEAKER7 3:17:45
What do I roll with that? 
SPEAKER3 3:17:46
It should say on the potion effect. 
SPEAKER7 3:17:47
I don't have the potion effect. You never gave it to me. Oh, fuck. 
SPEAKER2 3:17:50
Well, it's a potion. 
SPEAKER5 3:17:51
I don't have the potion effect. 
SPEAKER3 3:17:52
I don't have the potion effect. 
SPEAKER7 3:17:53
I don't have the potion effect. 
SPEAKER2 3:17:54
I don't have the potion effect. 
SPEAKER7 3:17:55
I don't have the potion effect. 
SPEAKER2 3:17:56
I don't have the potion effect. 
SPEAKER3 3:17:57
Oh, fuck. Well, it's a potion of fire breath, right? 
SPEAKER7 3:17:59
Yeah, I guess so. 
SPEAKER2 3:18:00
It has to do with dexterity saving throws. CHARLIE andżen forgot what that was. 
SPEAKER3 3:18:05
Dex thirteen saving throw taking 46. 
SPEAKER4 3:18:08
Potion? 
SPEAKER3 3:18:09
Forty six. Uh, yeah, cause it's a fire breath potion, not a fire breath attack. 
SPEAKER2 3:18:21
I was like, I don't need to only do three. 
SPEAKER5 3:18:25
Roll. Take two! 
SPEAKER2 3:18:27
Take two. I'll do my dex save. This is what World Angle says at least. 
SPEAKER5 3:18:33
Yeah, go ahead. 
SPEAKER7 3:18:34
You have failed. 
SPEAKER1 3:18:35
I passed. 
SPEAKER3 3:18:38
13 points of damage. 
SPEAKER5 3:18:40
13 points? 
SPEAKER7 3:18:42
Yes. 
SPEAKER2 3:18:45
Cool. 
SPEAKER4 3:18:46
So for succeeding, I take half. 
SPEAKER6 3:18:48
Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER3 3:18:49
So you take half. 
SPEAKER5 3:18:50
This guy gets immediately immolated into nothingness. 
SPEAKER3 3:18:54
This one, 14 points or 13? 
SPEAKER5 3:18:57
13 points? 
SPEAKER7 3:18:58
14. 
SPEAKER1 3:18:59
Oh, yeah, 13. 
SPEAKER3 3:19:00
13 is not having a great day, not going to lie. 
SPEAKER2 3:19:04
Because of my resistances and for succeeding, 
SPEAKER4 3:19:10
I take six damage for succeeding the save. I cut that in half because of my first resistance, which means I now take three. But because of my second level of resistance, I now take one damage, right? 
SPEAKER3 3:19:27
What? 
SPEAKER4 3:19:29
Because I have two types of damage resistance to fire. 
SPEAKER3 3:19:34
Oh, right, because you're both a sorcerer from a Draconic bloodline, and you're a dragon. 
SPEAKER2 3:19:41
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:19:42
Yep, you take one. 
SPEAKER1 3:19:44
Yippee! 
SPEAKER3 3:19:45
Cool. 
SPEAKER2 3:19:46
I love it. 
SPEAKER7 3:19:47
The wizard takes one. 
SPEAKER4 3:19:48
I don't know how to actually... 
SPEAKER2 3:19:49
I can't actually change it. 
SPEAKER4 3:19:50
So my primary action using that potion, 
SPEAKER7 3:19:52
I'm going to go ahead and use Giant's Might as my bonus action. 
SPEAKER3 3:19:55
Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER2 3:19:57
Oh, god. 
SPEAKER7 3:19:59
And with that, I'm going to go ahead and stack with Second Wind to place Twilight Sanctuary. 
SPEAKER3 3:20:08
Uh, Second Wind recovers hit points. 
SPEAKER7 3:20:10
Are you using Action Surge? 
SPEAKER1 3:20:11
Oh, wait. 
SPEAKER7 3:20:12
Uh, oh, wait, I don't have Action Surge. Never mind. 
SPEAKER1 3:20:15
We're leaving that as is. 
SPEAKER3 3:20:17
You should have Action Surge. 
SPEAKER7 3:20:19
I used it earlier. 
SPEAKER5 3:20:21
Oh, yeah, you did. 
SPEAKER3 3:20:22
Never mind. So what I'm going to do, 
SPEAKER7 3:20:25
is since my distance is... How does my distance work with the large size? 
SPEAKER3 3:20:31
Uh, you have 10-foot reach. 10-foot reach? Mm-hmm. Then I'm going to move close enough to order with the little bit of movement I have left. 
SPEAKER7 3:20:41
And... Let's see. 
SPEAKER1 3:20:45
I don't have any other actions left, so I guess as close as I can get. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 3:20:51
Did the Minot get obliterated in the fire? 
SPEAKER3 3:20:52
No. It did, however, get fucking scorched into a... into... diminution. It's... It's not having a great time. 
SPEAKER2 3:20:59
All right. So... 
SPEAKER3 3:21:01
It's not good. What you guys see, and especially what you see in Songhong, is... 
SPEAKER1 3:21:06
You cast Shatter. 
SPEAKER5 3:21:07
You see Jizzard uncork a potion and then scream in terror as it just whips out an attack at 
SPEAKER3 3:21:13
him, springing alive. You see Michi down a different potion and a gout of flame in the darkness at Jizzard. You then see Michi grow to this Herculean size. I'm not sure. This time, he'sнул? 
SPEAKER5 3:21:26
Is this the only time you see that? 
SPEAKER3 3:21:27
I don't think so. 
SPEAKER2 3:21:28
You're not seeing the entire thing? 
SPEAKER3 3:21:29
Not exactly. 
SPEAKER5 3:21:30
I mean, all of this is going on like a giant boom of chaos, the entire consciousness 
SPEAKER3 3:21:31
is breaking loose here. 
SPEAKER1 3:21:32
Fors, you are hearing the sounds of all of this and seeing glimpses of it. Can I not see over the bird's eye? 
SPEAKER3 3:21:35
You can see over it, but even then, because of how the, the, like, the hallway is, it's kind of narrow. So, you're catching glimpses of a lot of this. 
SPEAKER1 3:21:44
Okay. This is sheer chaos. Holy shit. Um. 
SPEAKER2 3:21:50
Damn. 
SPEAKER3 3:21:51
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Grimlock is still alive and active and well, and is going to take the opportunity to swipe at the roper that tried to eat it. And it's probably not going to do much. Yeah, it's not going to do anything, as it just kind of clangs against the stone carapace of this creature. And then it decides to literally scream into the wall that is the side of this creature. 
SPEAKER2 3:22:17
This maddening scream in the darkness. 
SPEAKER3 3:22:23
From there... Okay, cool. It is the incapacitated roper's turn. 
SPEAKER5 3:22:30
It makes a wisdom saving throw, correct? 
SPEAKER1 3:22:32
At the end of its turn? Michi? Michi? You're muted. 
SPEAKER7 3:22:46
Yeah, I had a bit of a thing I had to do. 
SPEAKER1 3:22:48
So every time the one that's incapacitated must do a saving throw 
SPEAKER7 3:22:52
until it... Actually breaks it. 
SPEAKER3 3:22:54
Okay, does an 18 break it? 
SPEAKER7 3:22:56
That does. 
SPEAKER1 3:22:58
Cool. 
SPEAKER5 3:22:59
And that's the end of its turn. 
SPEAKER3 3:23:01
So it is no longer incapacitated. 
SPEAKER7 3:23:08
Cool, cool, cool, cool. 
SPEAKER5 3:23:15
Yoink. 
SPEAKER3 3:23:16
That's the end of its turn. 
SPEAKER5 3:23:18
Forz, you're up. 
SPEAKER1 3:23:21
Okay. I'm going to move... behind. Still in stealth, if that matters, because it's difficult terrain. So... Yeah, I'll stay in stealth. No point trying to get through. I'm going to shoot over the bird's head at the roper. I think that's... Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. 
SPEAKER5 3:23:45
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 3:23:51
16. 16. 
SPEAKER3 3:23:53
Will not hit. 
SPEAKER1 3:23:56
Cool. That's all, folks. 
SPEAKER3 3:24:00
Or I need you to make another death saving throw. 
SPEAKER2 3:24:06
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 3:24:08
Your first death saving throw. 
SPEAKER1 3:24:10
Fine. Oh. 
SPEAKER2 3:24:20
It just barely passes. 
SPEAKER3 3:24:23
Ord. As this is your first death saving throw, I need you to describe a memory that brings you closer back to trying to revive yourself. Something that makes you, pushes you forward to become back from the brink. 
SPEAKER2 3:24:37
I think of the hotel room, or whatever it is, the bar hotel room with all the weird, weird, 
SPEAKER4 3:24:53
brain guys, infected dudes that we fought. 
SPEAKER2 3:24:57
I remember getting my axe up, getting ready, preparing to take them on. And it fills me with, you know, like adrenaline. With determination. 
SPEAKER4 3:25:17
Vigor. Excitement. Vigor. 
SPEAKER3 3:25:20
That's the word. Vigor. The vigor of a fight. The vigor. The thought that you might lose out on that pushes you one step closer to coming back from the brink. That is the end of your turn. Now the Roper's turn. It is going to, seeing that Michi is no longer grappled, it is going to use its tendrils on Michi. 
SPEAKER2 3:25:49
Michi, I... 
SPEAKER3 3:25:50
Hold your horses, sir, bucko. 
SPEAKER7 3:25:51
Vigor. 
SPEAKER3 3:25:52
Bucko. Go ahead. 
SPEAKER2 3:25:54
It's fell. Does an 11 hit? 
SPEAKER3 3:25:56
No. 
SPEAKER1 3:25:57
Cool. Second attack is also going to be at Michi. 
SPEAKER3 3:25:59
Does a 16 hit? No. 
SPEAKER2 3:26:01
Third attack is going for the other Grimlock. 
SPEAKER3 3:26:02
That will in fact hit. 
SPEAKER7 3:26:03
Fourth attack is going to come back at Michi. 
SPEAKER2 3:26:04
Does a 24 hit? 
SPEAKER3 3:26:05
It does. The Grimlock has been hit. Oh. The Grimlock has been hit. It's at the point now where they're going to be ready to go. Well, yeah, it's just going to get the right healing. It's going to be a little bit of a mess. You're gonna get stuck in there. Itоде. 
SPEAKER7 3:26:14
It's a bit of a mess. 
SPEAKER3 3:26:15
It's going to get you. It's going to be a lot of fun. Fourth attack is gonna come back at Michi. Does a 24 hit. It does. Cool. It's going to use real on this Grimlock to bring it close. And then now that it has two 
SPEAKER5 3:26:35
things within biting distance, Ord, I need you to pick evens or odds and then roll 
SPEAKER3 3:26:40
a d6. I pick odds. On odds, the Roper will try to bite you. Ord. Michi, jizzered in Songhanen Forest. First off, I am sorry. 
SPEAKER4 3:27:19
Oh no! 
SPEAKER3 3:27:24
That is a natural 20 with a plus 7 modifier. Ord, what are your final memories before you are dead? 
SPEAKER2 3:27:40
What? I still can't remember. 
SPEAKER4 3:27:42
I still got two deaths failures. 
SPEAKER3 3:27:44
A critical any melee hit on your character is a critical. Even if it wasn't, I rolled a critical. For death saves, whenever you start your turn at 0 HP, damage at 0 HP, if it is critical, is two automatic fails. You have an additional automatic fail from in Songhan. 
SPEAKER2 3:28:06
I think, uh... Think of the rabbits. Plenty. 
SPEAKER4 3:28:16
Think of the rabbits, George. Yeah, I'm thinking of the... All these stupid caverns and Ropers and everything we've been through in here. Thinking about the town and the magic and all the sneaking into the office. 
SPEAKER2 3:28:39
Uh... This little journey through space and time and... 
SPEAKER3 3:28:47
Well, not time. 
SPEAKER2 3:28:48
Through a lot of space to catch up with the party and... End up thinking about home. All my little elk herd. Wondering where they are. 
SPEAKER4 3:29:04
I never found out, but... 
SPEAKER2 3:29:06
Maybe... Hopefully better than... 
SPEAKER4 3:29:09
This whole whole year. 
SPEAKER2 3:29:14
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 3:29:18
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 3:29:19
Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 3:29:21
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 3:29:22
Okay. Okay. And with that, the rest of you see- Did I just fuckin' go to the restroom and come back to Ord dying? Yes. 
SPEAKER2 3:29:27
What the fuck? 
SPEAKER1 3:29:28
What the fuck? 
SPEAKER3 3:29:29
What the rest of you in the room see, as the Roper reaches out and lashes out with all four of its tendrils. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? It slithers out and lashes out with all four of its tendrils. And tried and failed to there the giant figure that is Michi, ensnaring a random grimlock For the players, if any of you have Revivify, you have one minute in-game to use that to bring Ord back. Otherwise, if no one has Revivify, or Greater Resurrection, or Lesser Resurrection, then 
SPEAKER2 3:30:25
this is the end for Ord. 
SPEAKER3 3:30:31
I would kindly ask Jake if you would stick around for the rest of the session. I know we're technically over already, but I'll probably end this combat encounter, and then we will end the session there. 
SPEAKER4 3:30:41
I cast Mending. 
SPEAKER3 3:30:45
It's not your turn. 
SPEAKER2 3:30:46
I know. It's not even going to help. 
SPEAKER3 3:30:50
In Songzhung, it is your turn. 
SPEAKER1 3:30:56
Grab his body! 
SPEAKER3 3:30:57
Something! 
SPEAKER1 3:30:58
Wait, is his body on the ground? 
SPEAKER7 3:31:01
Half of it is. 
SPEAKER1 3:31:02
Or does the Roper have it on the ground? 
SPEAKER3 3:31:03
The lifeless upper torso is still in the Roper's grasp. 
SPEAKER1 3:31:08
And did Michi yell to grab the body? 
SPEAKER3 3:31:13
I assume she did. Yes, I assume so. Mm-hmm. God, Isang is going to kind of... 
SPEAKER1 3:31:20
He's kind of shocked for a moment, stares, and then kind of looks at Michi, looks at the body. 
SPEAKER2 3:31:28
Um... And then... 
SPEAKER3 3:31:30
Yeah, he will, um... Kind of scurry out quickly. 
SPEAKER2 3:31:32
Wait, how many... 
SPEAKER1 3:31:33
He has... Sorry, let me look at movement just to double check. 
SPEAKER2 3:31:35
Yeah, 30. 
SPEAKER3 3:31:36
Um... 
SPEAKER1 3:31:37
He'll kind of move here and try to quickly grab with one hand, uh, probably Ord's hand, and just try to start dragging. Backwards. 
SPEAKER2 3:32:00
How heavy is it? 
SPEAKER1 3:32:01
Like, does it encumber me too much? 
SPEAKER3 3:32:06

SPEAKER3 3:37:38
uh which ability? 
SPEAKER1 3:37:40
it says hit a creature so would a kick count as a bonus action?

SPEAKER3 3:37:50
what are you trying to do? what are you trying to do? 
SPEAKER7 3:37:52
no i was trying to see if it was an attack but it's fine uh then if i'm grappled and i've already cast my main ability then i guess i'm just gonna have to use lucky and try to fucking wiggle free is that a possibility? 
SPEAKER3 3:38:11
yeah because you basically because you basically used your channel division divinity as a let me see is that a possibility? Let me see. Breaking a grapple. Escape grapple. That is an action. 
SPEAKER7 3:38:36
Okay. So I can't do that then? No. 
SPEAKER1 3:38:39
Alrighty. Well then, if that's 
SPEAKER7 3:38:41
the case, bonus action to just drink a fucking potion. 
SPEAKER3 3:38:45
Okay. Which potion? Uh, that's going to go ahead and be... 
SPEAKER7 3:38:50
One second, I'm looking at my fucking list. It's only at the bottom. This is going to be potion of heroism. 
SPEAKER3 3:39:00
Okay. 
SPEAKER7 3:39:05
Yeah, and then I guess I'm stuck here, so 
SPEAKER3 3:39:07

SPEAKER7 3:39:15
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 3:39:16
A potion of heroism. 
SPEAKER3 3:39:16

SPEAKER3 3:39:26
That's ten temporary. Ten temporary HP. And that will go to you. 
SPEAKER1 3:39:34
There you go. 
SPEAKER3 3:39:38
Okay. With the end of that turn is the first Grimlock's turn. He's going to go ahead and take an attack. 
SPEAKER5 3:39:46
Against the Roper. Against the Roper. Oh, critical. 
SPEAKER3 3:39:56
16. 
SPEAKER7 3:39:58
Supposed to be a 14 with that bonus. 
SPEAKER3 3:40:11
The Grimlock that the Roper had ensnared takes a wild swing and ends up embedding their bone cleaver into the eye of the Roper. It shrieks out this terrible scream as blood spurts from around the entire orifice. It actually took a pretty big hit. That's going to end its turn as its action. It has no movement. It is Roper. 
SPEAKER5 3:40:39
Huh? 
SPEAKER1 3:40:40
I'm a healer, that fucking Grimlock. That's... 
SPEAKER3 3:40:42
Sure, go ahead. Sure. 
SPEAKER6 3:40:48
Sure. 
SPEAKER4 3:40:53
Just want to make sure. 
SPEAKER3 3:40:54
The music is still playing for y'all, right? 
SPEAKER4 3:40:57
I can't hear anything. 
SPEAKER1 3:41:00
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 3:41:01
Sometimes it just doesn't want to do that. So. We'll see. We'll see. 
SPEAKER1 3:41:08
Cool. 
SPEAKER4 3:41:09
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 3:41:09
All right. Cool. The second Roper now takes its turn. It is going to use its tendril attack. 
SPEAKER6 3:41:15
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 3:41:16
First, it can use Reel on Yumichi to get you 25 feet in. 
SPEAKER5 3:41:20
That is five. And you're right up on it. 
SPEAKER3 3:41:24
I was going to say, 
SPEAKER7 3:41:25
I don't really have to move very far for that to happen. 
SPEAKER5 3:41:28
Then it will... Let's see. 
SPEAKER3 3:41:30
Let's see. It's going to use its bite attack on you as well. Does a 14 hit? 
SPEAKER4 3:41:38
I assume not. 
SPEAKER7 3:41:39
No. 
SPEAKER1 3:41:39
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 3:41:42
That's what it can do because everything else is kind of ensnared already. Well, not necessarily. 
SPEAKER1 3:41:50
The mimic. 
SPEAKER5 3:41:52
Well, the mimic ended Sanghong. 
SPEAKER4 3:41:58
I'm protecting Sanghong. You have my... My shield. 
SPEAKER5 3:42:01
Sanghong, does a 23 hit? 
SPEAKER1 3:42:05
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 3:42:06
I thought it was defending. 
SPEAKER3 3:42:08
I need you guys to pick between the two of you, evens or odds. 
SPEAKER4 3:42:12
Odds? 
SPEAKER1 3:42:14
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 3:42:15
It kind of seems like... 
SPEAKER2 3:42:16
You said... 
SPEAKER3 3:42:18
Okay, so Gizzard's taking odds and Sanghong's taking evens. 
SPEAKER1 3:42:21
And Sanghong, 
SPEAKER3 3:42:23
roll a d6. 
SPEAKER1 3:42:24
Oh, God. What? Okay. 
SPEAKER7 3:42:27
Oh. I forgot this feature. 
SPEAKER1 3:42:31
Is anybody currently roped? 
SPEAKER5 3:42:34
Gizzard is roped. 
SPEAKER3 3:42:37
And Sanghong is roped. 
SPEAKER1 3:42:39
Wait, what? 
SPEAKER4 3:42:40
I thought I defended you, Sanghong. 
SPEAKER7 3:42:41
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 3:42:42
I was going to say, 
SPEAKER7 3:42:42
he's not roped. 
SPEAKER1 3:42:44
And if he was, 
SPEAKER7 3:42:45
I'm going to go ahead 
SPEAKER6 3:42:46
and remember. 
SPEAKER7 3:42:46
I'm going to move it anyway for a moment. 
SPEAKER5 3:42:48
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 3:42:48
I thought I held my action to prevent that. 
SPEAKER5 3:42:51
Yeah, you held your action to take the hit. 
SPEAKER3 3:42:53
You are also grappled and cannot move. So, we roll. 
SPEAKER7 3:42:59
Hold on. 
SPEAKER1 3:43:00
Looking at Twilight, our divinity, 
SPEAKER7 3:43:01
it says you can end one effect causing it to be charmed. This benefit happens when any creature within 30 feet has an action 
SPEAKER3 3:43:08
or an effect on it. So, charmed. That's the specific word, right? 
SPEAKER1 3:43:12
No, it says end an effect 
SPEAKER7 3:43:14
causing it to be charmed. 
SPEAKER1 3:43:15
So, 
SPEAKER7 3:43:16
no, that would be on somebody else. Never mind. 
SPEAKER1 3:43:18
You're right. 
SPEAKER4 3:43:21
So, I didn't defend you, Sanghong? 
SPEAKER5 3:43:23
It was a contested thing 
SPEAKER3 3:43:24
to see if he would actually take the hit or if she would take the hit. But he would take the hit. 
SPEAKER4 3:43:28
Oh, is that what the roll was for? 
SPEAKER1 3:43:30
Yep. 
SPEAKER4 3:43:31
So, what was the point of odds and evens? 
SPEAKER3 3:43:33
To figure out which one of you 
SPEAKER5 3:43:34
was taking which side of the roll. 
SPEAKER4 3:43:36
I thought you said whoever took odd 
SPEAKER3 3:43:38
would get hit on an odd. 
SPEAKER1 3:43:42
And you took odds. 
SPEAKER3 3:43:44
So, you did not get hit because four is an even number. 
SPEAKER4 3:43:46
Oh, that's okay. I get it now. 
SPEAKER7 3:43:50
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 3:43:53
And Sanghong, you are roped, but you were not dragged. 
SPEAKER1 3:43:57
Okay. 
SPEAKER7 3:43:59
So, let me put some status effects on these things quick. 
SPEAKER5 3:44:02
That will end its turn. Forrest, you are up. 
SPEAKER1 3:44:08
I'm going to move forward. And I'm going to... Actually, I... Hang on. I'm... The spot right in front of me was where Sanghong was where they got grabbed, right? 
SPEAKER6 3:44:22
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 3:44:24
I'm going to stay where I am then. Actually, yeah. Because I can see it just fine. I don't know the range. But I don't want to move into a spot that I know is the range. 
SPEAKER3 3:44:35
Sorry. 
SPEAKER1 3:44:36
Sanghong was grabbed from right here. 
SPEAKER6 3:44:40
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 3:44:40
But I do believe 
SPEAKER4 3:44:42
Ord was grabbed from higher up. 
SPEAKER7 3:44:44
I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 3:44:45
Juzard was grabbed from right here. Michi was grabbed from right here as well. 
SPEAKER1 3:44:49
Okay. So, I'm not going to move into the space where people have been grabbed from because I can shoot it just fine from here. And I am going to shoot it 
SPEAKER2 3:44:56
in the face. 
SPEAKER1 3:45:00
Shoot her! Shoot her! Why is it always a 16? 
SPEAKER3 3:45:08
I don't know, 
SPEAKER7 3:45:09
but a 16 won't hit. 
SPEAKER6 3:45:09
Okay. 
SPEAKER7 3:45:14
Forrest, buddy. I need you to do something for us. 
SPEAKER2 3:45:16
I don't have anything else I can do. 
SPEAKER3 3:45:28
You don't have the ability 
SPEAKER5 3:45:29
to shoot again on a bonus action? 
SPEAKER1 3:45:31
Nope. Rogues don't get that. 
SPEAKER3 3:45:38
They get that with sharpshooter feet. Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 3:45:43
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 3:45:44
Okay. Sorry. I forgot. 
SPEAKER5 3:45:46
Because I played a rogue 
SPEAKER3 3:45:47
and then I was like, wait a minute. 
SPEAKER7 3:45:48
No. 
SPEAKER3 3:45:49
That's the thing you guys can do. 
SPEAKER1 3:45:51
I can't do anything else. 
SPEAKER3 3:45:54
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 3:45:55
Well done. 
SPEAKER3 3:45:58
Ord is dead. So, that is not a turn. 
SPEAKER2 3:46:00
No. 
SPEAKER5 3:46:03
It is the roper that killed him. 
SPEAKER3 3:46:05
Killed him's turn. 
SPEAKER1 3:46:10
No. 
SPEAKER3 3:46:12
It is going to go ahead and use its attack 
SPEAKER7 3:46:14
on the Grimloid. 
SPEAKER3 3:46:15
Grimlock. 
SPEAKER5 3:46:18
Yoink. 
SPEAKER1 3:46:20
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 3:46:20
Fuck him up. 
SPEAKER6 3:46:21
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:46:21
That'll do it. 
SPEAKER5 3:46:22
Yeah. And 18 hits and 20 damage. 
SPEAKER6 3:46:24
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:46:24
This Grimlock is dead. 
SPEAKER1 3:46:26
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 3:46:28
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 3:46:29
Damn. 
SPEAKER4 3:46:30
That's unfortunate. 
SPEAKER2 3:46:32
He was helping. 
SPEAKER3 3:46:42
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 3:46:42
That one's dead as well. 
SPEAKER3 3:46:43
Cool. 
SPEAKER7 3:46:44
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 3:46:44
Cool. And then, Jizzard, you were roped by that one, right? 
SPEAKER2 3:46:51
By this one. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:46:53
Ping for me real quick. 
SPEAKER4 3:46:54
It's not going to be ping. Hold down mouse button. 
SPEAKER2 3:46:57
This one. 
SPEAKER4 3:46:58
You have the measurement tool active. You have the measurement tool active. 
SPEAKER5 3:47:01
So, it's going to use its reel 
SPEAKER3 3:47:02
to bring you in 25 feet closer. That's five, ten. 
SPEAKER5 3:47:08
There we go. 
SPEAKER3 3:47:09
And you're in biting range now. 
SPEAKER7 3:47:11
Cool. 
SPEAKER4 3:47:12
Bite me, I dare you. 
SPEAKER3 3:47:14
Cool. And that'll be its turn. Insunghan, you are up. 
SPEAKER1 3:47:21
Break free, little bird. 
SPEAKER4 3:47:25
Break free from the chains that bind you. 
SPEAKER1 3:47:27
Yes. Oh, my God. 
SPEAKER6 3:47:29
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 3:47:34
Insunghan will... 
SPEAKER2 3:47:40
Oh, my God. Um... 
SPEAKER3 3:47:44
Did I... 
SPEAKER7 3:47:45
Little dude just died, by the way. 
SPEAKER6 3:47:46
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER7 3:47:48
Okay, I'm going to add one HP to my pool again. 
SPEAKER4 3:47:52
Our little jabroni. 
SPEAKER7 3:47:54
My little, uh... 
SPEAKER6 3:47:54
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 3:47:56
Is that interesting? 
SPEAKER2 3:48:00
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 3:48:01
20 foot radius. So, um... 
SPEAKER4 3:48:04
Oh, no. 
SPEAKER1 3:48:05
I'm going to try to check some of this. God damn it. I think Insunghan will, 
SPEAKER3 3:48:12
just in a panic, 
SPEAKER1 3:48:13
throw a fireball 
SPEAKER6 3:48:15
to the wall. 
SPEAKER5 3:48:15
Oh, my God. 
SPEAKER3 3:48:15
To kind of the back wall. 
SPEAKER1 3:48:17
Like, right... 
SPEAKER5 3:48:19
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 3:48:19
I can take it. 
SPEAKER1 3:48:20
Hit me. 
SPEAKER7 3:48:21
That wouldn't hit Michi. 
SPEAKER5 3:48:22
Pin you again, right? 
SPEAKER1 3:48:23
I'm trying to, like... What? From, like, right here. I'm trying to, like, measure it, and I don't want... 
SPEAKER3 3:48:29
Because, like... 
SPEAKER1 3:48:30
Okay, each one's... 
SPEAKER5 3:48:31
20 feet is right here. 
SPEAKER3 3:48:32
It will not hit Michi. 
SPEAKER1 3:48:35
But it will hit both of the, um... 
SPEAKER3 3:48:37
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 3:48:39
I'm going to do that. Let me... Hit me. And, uh... Yeah, he just, like... Basically, not just, like, he cast it. He, like, panics and flings out instantly, like, 
SPEAKER3 3:48:55
in a very, like, reactionary matter, 
SPEAKER1 3:48:57
a full-ass fireball. 
SPEAKER2 3:49:03
And... 
SPEAKER6 3:49:03
Um... 
SPEAKER1 3:49:04
I rolled it. Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER5 3:49:08
So, I need a dexterity saving throw. 
SPEAKER2 3:49:11
Um... 
SPEAKER1 3:49:11
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 3:49:12
Mm-hmm-hmm. 
SPEAKER7 3:49:14
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 3:49:15
Comparative to the size of these things, are these things bigger than me by long shot, I'm guessing? 
SPEAKER3 3:49:19
Not now. Not now that you are giant. 
SPEAKER7 3:49:22
Well, they are the whole me, so I was kind of curious. 
SPEAKER4 3:49:25
8d6 fire damage? Jesus. 
SPEAKER3 3:49:28
It is 8d6 fire damage. They are not bigger than you, no. 
SPEAKER7 3:49:32
About the same size, roughly, though? 
SPEAKER3 3:49:34
Yeah, about the same size. 
SPEAKER2 3:49:35
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 3:49:36
What is your spell save DC in Songhong? 
SPEAKER1 3:49:40
My spell save... One second, one second. It is... I think it's 13. Yes. 
SPEAKER3 3:49:53
Okay, one succeeds, one fails. Please roll your damage. Even on a success, they take half damage. 
SPEAKER1 3:49:59
Okay. Cool. 
SPEAKER4 3:50:02
Imagine getting a critical. I know you don't roll anything. 
SPEAKER7 3:50:07
Damn. 
SPEAKER3 3:50:08
Mmm. Okay. 
SPEAKER7 3:50:13
The yeetis has been yeeted. 
SPEAKER1 3:50:16
Fireball! Fireball! Fireball! How did I do? How'd I do? 
SPEAKER5 3:50:22
Pretty good. Pretty good. Not the highest I've seen, but pretty damn good. 
SPEAKER1 3:50:26
Fireball. 
SPEAKER3 3:50:31
The one that you saw eviscerate ore... 
SPEAKER4 3:50:35
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 3:50:36
...now looks kind of fucked up. 
SPEAKER5 3:50:38
They're kind of... They're bloody and they are burned in there. 
SPEAKER7 3:50:40
They are scorched. 
SPEAKER3 3:50:41
The other one that you hit took the full damage. 
SPEAKER1 3:50:48
Hello? 
SPEAKER5 3:50:49
Yeah, I'm still here. Can you hear me? 
SPEAKER1 3:50:51
Oh, sorry. It just stopped for a second. 
SPEAKER7 3:50:54
No, I was, you know, calculating still in my head. 
SPEAKER1 3:50:57
Oh, sorry. 
SPEAKER3 3:50:58
A lot of numbers. Um... You know, the walls have HP and everything. Um... 
SPEAKER1 3:51:04
Oh, no. 
SPEAKER3 3:51:05
Yes. Anyway, um... Don't worry about that. So the first roper, the one that you are... that you rescued the body of Ord from, loses all of its tentacles and looks fucked up. The second one... 
SPEAKER5 3:51:24
You see it take damage. You see that it is... it's not doing super great. It's not living la vida loca. 
SPEAKER3 3:51:29
And it's losing two limbs, but it is still there and it still has the other two. One wrapped around Michi. 
SPEAKER1 3:51:36
Am I still grappled? 
SPEAKER3 3:51:37
You are no longer grappled. 
SPEAKER1 3:51:40
I still have my movement, right? 
SPEAKER3 3:51:42
Yep, you still have your movement. Jizzard, you are also no longer grappled. 
SPEAKER2 3:51:45
I... 
SPEAKER1 3:51:46
Both these shitsheads just took fucking emetric fun of damage, right? 
SPEAKER7 3:51:49
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 3:51:50
Uh... they did just take a decent amount of damage, yes. 
SPEAKER3 3:51:52
Okay. Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 3:51:54
Isanon's gonna just scurry. Like, he's going to just silently, just fast as he can possibly run, and probably, like, bump into Fours. 
SPEAKER5 3:52:04
Hey, are you still bringing Ord with you? 
SPEAKER1 3:52:06
No. No, he's booking it. He's terrified. He's just fucking fleeing. 
SPEAKER5 3:52:13
There is an attack of opportunity that you get from the mimic. 
SPEAKER7 3:52:16
Oh... 
SPEAKER1 3:52:17
Don't leave us! I'm stuck here, you bird! 
SPEAKER3 3:52:20
He does a seven hit. 
SPEAKER7 3:52:22
No. 
SPEAKER3 3:52:23
Okay, cool. You're scot-free. 
SPEAKER1 3:52:24
Let me double check. Actually, let me double... I was thinking no immediately, but let me double check. Sorry. 
SPEAKER2 3:52:30
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 3:52:32
Um... 
SPEAKER2 3:52:34
I... 
SPEAKER1 3:52:35
I shouldn't... It's trying to beat my armor, right? 
SPEAKER3 3:52:39
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 3:52:40
Or... 
SPEAKER3 3:52:41
It doesn't hit. 
SPEAKER7 3:52:42
Yeah. Oh, yeah, no. It does not hit. 
SPEAKER2 3:52:45
It was busted. 
SPEAKER7 3:52:50
Oh! Okay. I actually forgot about that being a part of this potion I drank. 
SPEAKER2 3:52:56
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 3:52:59
Okay, so, that's the Songhong's turn, which brings us to Gizzard. What are you up to? 
SPEAKER4 3:53:03
I... Once the fucking loud-ass tone ends... 
SPEAKER2 3:53:07
Um... 
SPEAKER4 3:53:09
This thing's fucked up, you say? 
SPEAKER3 3:53:12
Uh, the Roper is bloodied. However, you saw what it took to get it there. 
SPEAKER2 3:53:17
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 3:53:21
Let me, uh... Sorry. My fucking thing turned off. Ugh. Ugh. I'm trying. Hold on. 
SPEAKER1 3:53:29
Ugh. Ugh. 
SPEAKER2 3:53:31
Meh. 
SPEAKER4 3:53:32
Meh. 
SPEAKER2 3:53:33
All right. 
SPEAKER1 3:53:34
Sir? 
SPEAKER4 3:53:35
I spank this bitch with burning hands. 
SPEAKER3 3:53:38
Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 3:53:41
The only thing I was... Because... Because fire. 
SPEAKER4 3:53:45
Uh... Oh, wait! Oh, I'm a dingus. I'm a big fucking dingus. Mm. Because of my elemental affinity with fire, I get, like, some kind of bonus for using fire spells, and I have not been doing that. 
SPEAKER6 3:54:00
Mm. 
SPEAKER2 3:54:01
Ugh. 
SPEAKER4 3:54:02
It's almost like when the party doesn't know the characters, things become a lot harder. Well, it hasn't, like, come up at all. 
SPEAKER2 3:54:10
Uh, hold on. 
SPEAKER7 3:54:13
I'm fairly certain there was one thing that Michi was trying to kind of, like, bolster the ads. 
SPEAKER4 3:54:21
In the most American tone I can do. Okay, um, alright. Uh, yeah, Burning Hands. It must succeed a dexterity saving throw past 15. 
SPEAKER3 3:54:37
Yeah, that's a 4. 
SPEAKER4 3:54:39
Okay, and then I slash roll 1d... Or no, 3d6. Okay, that's pretty bad. And then I... what do I do? 
SPEAKER1 3:54:52
Oh! 
SPEAKER4 3:54:57
Add Charisma modifier to 1d6. Damage roll. I don't know what that means. 
SPEAKER3 3:55:04
It means you add your Charisma modifier to this. What's your Charisma modifier? 
SPEAKER1 3:55:07
Okay, it takes 14. 
SPEAKER5 3:55:08
Total? 
SPEAKER2 3:55:09
Or no, 12 total. 
SPEAKER3 3:55:11
Total? Okay. 
SPEAKER2 3:55:12
Fire. 
SPEAKER5 3:55:13
It definitely still is... it's getting more bloody. 
SPEAKER3 3:55:16
This did more damage to it. 
SPEAKER1 3:55:18
It's still alive, though. 
SPEAKER4 3:55:20
Bitch. 
SPEAKER5 3:55:22
Anything else in your turn? 
SPEAKER7 3:55:25
No. 
SPEAKER2 3:55:29
No. No. No. 
SPEAKER1 3:55:30
No. 
SPEAKER6 3:55:30
No. 
SPEAKER2 3:55:30
What does the one in front of you look like? 
SPEAKER5 3:55:31
Uh, the one in front of you doesn't look bloody. A little bit worn, but not bloody. 
SPEAKER7 3:55:36
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 3:55:37
Quit trying to kill me and kill me. 
SPEAKER4 3:55:40
Time for the Mimic. 
SPEAKER5 3:55:41
It will use its pseudopod against Jizzard. 
SPEAKER3 3:55:44
Jizzard, I need to know, does an 18 hit? 
SPEAKER1 3:55:48
Yeah, uh, no. 
SPEAKER3 3:55:50
Matches your armor class? 
SPEAKER1 3:55:52
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 3:55:53
Then no. 
SPEAKER2 3:55:54
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 3:55:56
That's what it can do? 
SPEAKER5 3:55:59
Michi, you're up. 
SPEAKER2 3:55:59
Okay 
SPEAKER1 3:56:03
Michi is up So this guy in front of me is not bloody but took a shit ton of damage 
SPEAKER3 3:56:08
Yeah 
SPEAKER7 3:56:09
Okay I'm going to 
SPEAKER1 3:56:16
Swipe at it with my 
SPEAKER7 3:56:17
Greatsword 
SPEAKER2 3:56:19
Okay 
SPEAKER7 3:56:21
Nice cuddling clash against the tentacles 
SPEAKER1 3:56:23
In its face 
SPEAKER3 3:56:24
Are you going for the tentacle or for it? 
SPEAKER7 3:56:28
It I'm actually going for this motherfucker 
SPEAKER3 3:56:30
Good to know 
SPEAKER7 3:56:32
Apparently got an unexpected error 
SPEAKER1 3:56:35
When trying to use my weapon 
SPEAKER7 3:56:36
So let me look what my fucking weapon apparently is 
SPEAKER4 3:56:39
I can't believe I forgot about elemental affinity It's fucking pissing me off 
SPEAKER2 3:56:43
I can't tell if it's any different than the other ones 
SPEAKER7 3:56:51
So I'm guessing it's 2d6 
SPEAKER2 3:56:53
Right 
SPEAKER1 3:56:58
Right 
SPEAKER7 3:56:58
Right 
SPEAKER6 3:56:58
Right 
SPEAKER7 3:56:58
Right 
SPEAKER6 3:56:59
Right 
SPEAKER1 3:56:59
One second 
SPEAKER2 3:57:00
And then I'm going to roll for its actual fucking thing Does a 7 hit? 
SPEAKER3 3:57:15
Does a 7 hit? 
SPEAKER1 3:57:17
Yes Well I don't give a fuck so I'm chaining this motherfucker to the ground 
SPEAKER2 3:57:21
Okay 
SPEAKER7 3:57:25
You see a fiery chain just start wrapping around me I'm using fire rune if you're curious what I'm actually doing So you need to do a 
SPEAKER3 3:57:38
DC 13 Deck save? That's cool 
SPEAKER2 3:57:45
I believe that's 
SPEAKER5 3:57:47
Let me double check again 
SPEAKER7 3:57:48
My eyes burn 
SPEAKER2 3:57:50
Oh hold on So I'm going to do a DC 13 So what the fuck? 
SPEAKER3 3:57:59
So I'm going to do a DC 13 
SPEAKER2 3:58:00
So what the fuck? 
SPEAKER3 3:58:04
Also your sword should give you an attack bonus 
SPEAKER1 3:58:06
Yeah, that's what I thought 
SPEAKER7 3:58:07

SPEAKER4 4:00:17
nevermind then we're gonna hold off 
SPEAKER3 4:00:19
why am I fucking misreading things anyways yeah I guess that ends my turn 
SPEAKER2 4:00:26
because I ain't got shit else to do 
SPEAKER3 4:00:27
okay then it becomes ah the rovers fire rune it is going to use its let's see let's see hey in song huh 
SPEAKER1 4:00:54
yeah 
SPEAKER2 4:00:55
yeah yeah 
SPEAKER3 4:00:57
 
SPEAKER7 4:01:27
before this podcast anyone knows a lot about fire combat with fl Huang 
SPEAKER3 4:01:30
um 
SPEAKER2 4:01:34
uh for sure 
SPEAKER7 4:01:36
there was a comment which made me nervous to the anticipatre 
SPEAKER2 4:01:39
im going to help my in song punk 
SPEAKER7 4:01:40
misfit 
SPEAKER2 4:01:41
and I gotta reset my little 
SPEAKER3 4:01:45
in song Hong does a 12 hit you 
SPEAKER2 4:01:47
lum 
SPEAKER1 4:01:48
actually 
SPEAKER7 4:01:50
noble 
SPEAKER2 4:01:51
my gosh 
SPEAKER3 4:01:55
I was going to say it shouldn't 
SPEAKER2 4:01:56
yepi 
SPEAKER3 4:01:56
did we already change現 counter and why did my anything not go off what thing 
SPEAKER7 4:01:57
I was supposed to receive an additional back for that, so one second. 
SPEAKER3 4:02:03
Okay. I'll let you figure that out. That is the roper's turn, as it attacks the two tendrils it has left. Fours, you are now up. 
SPEAKER1 4:02:12
Cool! I'm going to shoot it again! Okay! That's significantly better! Does a natural 20, that makes it a 27 hit? 
SPEAKER3 4:02:27
Yes. It does, and it also makes it so you have sneak attack. 
SPEAKER1 4:02:31
I have sneak attack anyway. Because I'm hidden and I have flanking. 
SPEAKER3 4:02:35
And you have an ally within 5 feet, so that means you have sneak attack and you double the sneak attack damage as well. 
SPEAKER1 4:02:40
Yes, so let's hope that this button... Like that. Two fucking tables. Um, hang on. 
SPEAKER2 4:02:47
I need to figure out how to use this. 
SPEAKER1 4:02:51
I don't know what I'm doing. Um... I think my sneak attack is 2d6 right now because of... 
SPEAKER4 4:03:01
Nope, it should be something... 
SPEAKER1 4:03:03
Nope, it's 1. 
SPEAKER3 4:03:04
No, it should be higher than that. I believe sneak attack scales with your level. It should be more like 4 or 5d6. 
SPEAKER1 4:03:13
Um, let me pull up a quick sneak attack table. And let's see what we can do. Okay, uh, it's 3d6. Excellent. So... Sneak attack is 3d6, and then the damage on this is gonna be... 
SPEAKER3 4:03:29
Mm-hmm. Remember it is a magic weapon as well, so you have additional damage. 
SPEAKER1 4:03:32
I don't know how the magic... Okay, I'm gonna click the macro, and we're gonna see what happens. I'm also gonna add the 3d6 for... that. Um... 26? I think? 
SPEAKER3 4:03:46
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 4:03:48
I don't know if that count... if that doubles the dice or not. Or if that takes into account the magic thing. But, uh... Might be... I don't know. 26. It's not awful. The first time in a while. 
SPEAKER3 4:04:01
Uh, 26. That is... Uh, do-do-do-do... 
SPEAKER2 4:04:06
3... 4... 8... 
SPEAKER3 4:04:12
Wait a minute. Yeah, 4, 8, 12... 16... Plus another 8 would be... 24 plus another 2 is 26. So that does not double the dice. So it's 22 doubled, plus 4. So that is 48 damage. Oh. 
SPEAKER4 4:04:34
That's not awful. 
SPEAKER5 4:04:35
No, in fact, how would you like to kill the one that, uh, eviscerated your friend? 
SPEAKER3 4:04:38
That cleaved them in half? 
SPEAKER1 4:04:40
At this point... I just want it to be over. I just wanna hit it, and I just want it to die. I just want it to die. 
SPEAKER3 4:04:47
Okay, I'm gonna make it sound a bit more epic. Draw back the twin dragon, uh... The twin dragons that make up the front part of your bow. Their eyes ignite with electricity as it crackles along the bow and then meets at the bowstring before you unleash the torrent of electricity and skewer through, blasting a hole through the center of this creature. It is now very dead. 
SPEAKER2 4:05:13
That's true. Which one is it? This one? 
SPEAKER7 4:05:18
Cool. Very dead. 
SPEAKER3 4:05:23
That ends your turn, bringing us to Insonghun. You are up. Daggers! Do the daggers! 
SPEAKER1 4:05:33
I would say, honestly, at this point, Isoghan is still just kind of panicking. And he's gonna kind of... Not like clawing at fours, but kind of like trying to kind of push them aside to like get through, or like kind of squeeze past. 
SPEAKER2 4:05:53
Um... 
SPEAKER3 4:05:58
And, yeah, I don't know, they're just... If that's what you want to spend your action to do, make a contested strength check against fours. 
SPEAKER1 4:06:05
So I have to roll strength? 
SPEAKER3 4:06:07
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 4:06:08
Okay! 
SPEAKER1 4:06:10
It's like watching TV. 
SPEAKER4 4:06:11
It's like watching two fucking flies arm-wrestling. 
SPEAKER3 4:06:16
Hm. 
SPEAKER4 4:06:17
Jesus. Yeah, nope. 
SPEAKER7 4:06:19
I'd say... 
SPEAKER1 4:06:20
I guess it's just like, with pure adrenaline and panic, Isonghun probably manages. 
SPEAKER3 4:06:28
You kind of shove fours half to the ground, climb over and just fly past, and are able to move through fours' space. It's still difficult terrain, but you're at least able to get to the other side. All right. 
SPEAKER1 4:06:42
He's gonna essentially just end up probably like right here. 
SPEAKER3 4:06:52
Okay. Okay. That's your turn. Jizzard, you are up. 
SPEAKER4 4:07:00
Okay, the thing is dead now. 
SPEAKER3 4:07:02
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 4:07:03
I don't... 
SPEAKER4 4:07:05
I can't bring Ord back to life. 
SPEAKER2 4:07:07
You could assist him. 
SPEAKER7 4:07:08
You could assist me? Over here? 
SPEAKER1 4:07:10
Getting my ass kicked there, dragon boy? 
SPEAKER2 4:07:12
Uh... This mimic is just gonna hang out. I'm just gonna stomp the mimic. 
SPEAKER4 4:07:19
Like, it's pretty fucked up. I'm just gonna squish any life that remained from it under my boot. 
SPEAKER3 4:07:25
Roll a... 
SPEAKER5 4:07:26
Are you sure you want to do just an unarmed melee attack? 
SPEAKER2 4:07:29
I'll cast Fireball on the... No. 
SPEAKER4 4:07:34
I'll just like... 
SPEAKER2 4:07:36
Um... 
SPEAKER4 4:07:37
Yeah, I'll just fucking squish with boot. 
SPEAKER3 4:07:44
It looks fucked up. It doesn't look that fucked up. 
SPEAKER5 4:07:48
It doesn't look like it's one or two HP from dead. 
SPEAKER2 4:07:51
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 4:07:52
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 4:07:53
I thought it was like super fucked up. 
SPEAKER4 4:07:57
Fine then. 
SPEAKER2 4:07:59
Shit. I'll just shock and grasp that, Jon. 
SPEAKER3 4:08:06
I'll pick it up. 
SPEAKER4 4:08:08
It's feeble life in my hand. 
SPEAKER2 4:08:11
And just zap him. Give him the ol' zap. 
SPEAKER4 4:08:15
Okay. So, I mean, I guess I have to technically roll. Um... 
SPEAKER3 4:08:21
Does it... 
SPEAKER2 4:08:22
Yeah, that'll work. Yep. 
SPEAKER4 4:08:24
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 4:08:25
Alright. 
SPEAKER2 4:08:26
Slash. 
SPEAKER4 4:08:27
Roll. 
SPEAKER2 4:08:28
2d8. 
SPEAKER4 4:08:29
Uh, how does, uh, 8 damage do? 
SPEAKER2 4:08:32
Uh, 8 damage is... 
SPEAKER4 4:08:33
Uh, 8 damage is... Uh, 8 damage is... 
SPEAKER3 4:08:35
Uh, 8 damage definitely fucks it up more, but it's still around. 
SPEAKER2 4:08:39
It's still alive! 
SPEAKER4 4:08:40
It is still alive and it is still a problem. Fuck! Can I, like, yeet it across the... 
SPEAKER2 4:08:46
Oh, I don't want to yeet it across the room. 
SPEAKER4 4:08:49
I'll just, like, stare at it. 
SPEAKER2 4:08:52
And be like, fucking stupid little bitch. 
SPEAKER3 4:08:58
And that's it. So, you're just staring at it? Staring it down? Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 4:09:02
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 4:09:03
Then that's your turn. It is now its turn. It is going to try to pseudopod you again. Fuck. 
SPEAKER2 4:09:08
Try me. 
SPEAKER4 4:09:09
Does another 7 hit? No. 
SPEAKER2 4:09:11
Cool. Fuck. 
SPEAKER3 4:09:13
Why won't anything kill me? Michi, you're up. Please let me die. 
SPEAKER4 4:09:16
I'm about ready to fucking heal this mimic, I swear to god. 
SPEAKER7 4:09:21
Is it my turn or the fucking mimic's turn? No, it's your turn. 
SPEAKER2 4:09:28
Oh, my god. I'm so fucking tired. I'm so fucking tired. I'm so fucking tired. 
SPEAKER1 4:09:32
I'm so fucking tired. 
SPEAKER3 4:09:33
No, it's your turn. Okay. 
SPEAKER7 4:09:35
I thought it mimicked was after jizzer. I thought it mimicked was after jizzer. 
SPEAKER3 4:09:37
Okay. 
SPEAKER7 4:09:38
I'm gonna take another fucking swipe at this dude who's pissing me the hell off. 
SPEAKER3 4:09:44
So we're gonna go ahead and swing that motherfucking sword at him. Wobble I am. Oh, there's a 12 hit. 
SPEAKER5 4:10:00
A 12 does not hit. Also, a 12. I feel like is not the right calculation you got here. 
SPEAKER7 4:10:07
For a roll 20? For an attack? 
SPEAKER5 4:10:09
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 4:10:11
What do you mean? 
SPEAKER7 4:10:12
How is that not correct? I'm not rolling for damage. I'm rolling to attack. 
SPEAKER5 4:10:19
Do you know your previous... Yeah, no, no. 
SPEAKER3 4:10:20
Okay, never mind. 
SPEAKER6 4:10:21
Hold on, hold on. 
SPEAKER1 4:10:23
No, that is correct. 
SPEAKER7 4:10:24
Never mind. 
SPEAKER3 4:10:24
I am just dumb. 
SPEAKER7 4:10:26
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 4:10:27
Then, fuck this. I'm going to use a lucky token, because that apparently... Does that allow you to swipe again? 
SPEAKER3 4:10:32
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 4:10:35
So then I'll roll a fucking again. 
SPEAKER3 4:10:46
Yeah, that'll do it. 
SPEAKER5 4:10:46
That was a 26 hit. Yeah, uh-huh. 
SPEAKER3 4:10:49
Damn, that animation was kind of nice. I'm not going to lie. 
SPEAKER1 4:10:53
Fucking hell. 
SPEAKER7 4:10:55
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 4:10:56
We're going to roll for fucking damage now. 
SPEAKER2 4:11:02
Ooh, damage. 
SPEAKER3 4:11:04
Yeah, it's going to be fucking normal damage. Watch this shit. 
SPEAKER5 4:11:07
Well, it's 2d6 plus 2. Roll an additional 1d6. 
SPEAKER1 4:11:14
Yes, I fucking will. Thank you very much. 
SPEAKER3 4:11:16
We're going to roll for 6 damage. 
SPEAKER4 4:11:19
So it takes 6 fucking points of damage, my guy. 
SPEAKER3 4:11:26
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER7 4:11:27
Does that hurt the creature at all? 
SPEAKER5 4:11:29
It does. It hurt it. 
SPEAKER1 4:11:32
Is it fucking anything? 
SPEAKER5 4:11:33
Is it alive? Yeah, it's bloody now. 
SPEAKER1 4:11:36
Then I'm going to use my last fucking fire breath on this son of a bitch. Why is Michi the one fucking soloing a goddamn roper right now? 
SPEAKER3 4:11:46
Well, or it tries to. 
SPEAKER1 4:11:50
And I ran out of spells. 
SPEAKER3 4:11:53
God damn it. 
SPEAKER5 4:11:55
Another 10. 
SPEAKER1 4:11:57
Take fucking 10 points of damage, you piece of shit roper. 
SPEAKER3 4:12:00
Just go away. 
SPEAKER5 4:12:00
It's getting... It's getting fucked up now. It's getting pretty fucked up. 
SPEAKER1 4:12:05
Hmm. You know what? Then we're going to use one more fucking... Oh, wait. 
SPEAKER7 4:12:08
I can't use Fury of the Small. We already went through that. 
SPEAKER6 4:12:11
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 4:12:11
So then, um... 
SPEAKER7 4:12:13
I ain't got shit else to do. 
SPEAKER6 4:12:15
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 4:12:16
Jezzit, hand, please. Throw that thing at it. 
SPEAKER4 4:12:19
I'm trying. 
SPEAKER5 4:12:23
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 4:12:24
That's the end of your turn. I'm tired, boss. 
SPEAKER2 4:12:26
Just let me... Let me sleep. 
SPEAKER5 4:12:28
The roper's turn. 
SPEAKER3 4:12:31
Why... Why does the music always just stop? I'll redo that in a second. 
SPEAKER4 4:12:37
Just attack me. 
SPEAKER1 4:12:39
Hey, look at that. 
SPEAKER3 4:12:40
I got... 
SPEAKER7 4:12:40
I got 3 HP back. 
SPEAKER1 4:12:42
Jezzit. 
SPEAKER4 4:12:42
Let me use... 
SPEAKER3 4:12:43
It's going to use a tendril. 
SPEAKER5 4:12:44
Uh, it doesn't... An 18 does not hit you, does it? 
SPEAKER1 4:12:46
No. 
SPEAKER4 4:12:47
Fuck. 
SPEAKER3 4:12:49
Cool. 
SPEAKER5 4:12:50
Michi, it's going to use its bite against you. 
SPEAKER3 4:12:52
Um, I'm going to need to know. 
SPEAKER1 4:12:53
Does a 24 hit? Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 4:12:55
Please take 22 points of piercing damage. 
SPEAKER1 4:12:58
Oh, didn't anything hit me? 
SPEAKER4 4:12:59
I've had, like, 4 health for the longest time. 
SPEAKER1 4:13:01
Why do you want to die? Because I want to use my special item. 
SPEAKER4 4:13:10
I've been itching to use this thing. 
SPEAKER1 4:13:14
How are you feeling, Michi? 
SPEAKER6 4:13:14
Hey, look. 
SPEAKER1 4:13:14
How are you... How are you doing on health? Like, not the number, but, like, what... Brutal. 
SPEAKER6 4:13:21
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 4:13:21
That's... That's not ideal at all. 
SPEAKER5 4:13:25
And then it will use its last thing 
SPEAKER3 4:13:27
to extrude another tendril, so it now has 3. And that is its turn. 
SPEAKER2 4:13:31
So, I'm going to use my bow. 
SPEAKER5 4:13:32
4 is your up. 
SPEAKER1 4:13:33
Yeah, so I'm going to shoot it. With my bow. 
SPEAKER3 4:13:37
Here I go. 
SPEAKER1 4:13:38
What is your... What is your archetype, please? 23. 
SPEAKER5 4:13:41
I have the alert feet, so nothing can surprise me. But it doesn't matter. 
SPEAKER3 4:13:43
No, no. 
SPEAKER1 4:13:44
Your subclass. What's your subclass? Criminal. I lie to people and I steal things. 
SPEAKER5 4:13:48
Yeah, we're basically the same person. 
SPEAKER3 4:13:49
I'm... 
SPEAKER1 4:13:50
So, I took the... It's either criminal or... Criminal. 
SPEAKER2 4:13:53
I'm going to use my bow. I'm going to use my bow. 
SPEAKER1 4:13:55
I'm going to use my bow. 
SPEAKER4 4:13:56
I'm going to use my bow. 
SPEAKER2 4:13:57
I'm going to use my bow. 
SPEAKER3 4:13:58
I'm going to use my bow. 
SPEAKER1 4:13:59
So, I took the... It's either criminal or... Like, I want to say it's criminal with the subtype spy. Oh. But I don't, like... 
SPEAKER4 4:14:07
Oh, shit. 
SPEAKER1 4:14:08
Anyway, 23 to hit. 23 will hit. 
SPEAKER5 4:14:10
Can I go back on a turn for the damage that's actually supposed to be applied? 
SPEAKER3 4:14:15
What's the damage that's supposed to be applied? 
SPEAKER7 4:14:17
Giant's might, 1d6. Okay, roll an additional 1d6. 
SPEAKER3 4:14:21
And then 4s also roll your sneak attack damage. 
SPEAKER2 4:14:25
This time you don't get to double it, unfortunately. 
SPEAKER1 4:14:28
No, that's... 
SPEAKER4 4:14:29
That's 5. Double it and give to the next roper. 
SPEAKER1 4:14:31
That's 5. 
SPEAKER3 4:14:32
Don't do these things. 
SPEAKER7 4:14:33
Take an additional 5, because I fucking forgot about that being active. 
SPEAKER1 4:14:36
24 damage. 
SPEAKER3 4:14:37
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 4:14:38
Finally, I can hit things. 
SPEAKER1 4:14:39
So, another 29 damage. See, it's nice when I can, like, you know, do damage and not just roll fucking 16s the 
SPEAKER2 4:14:51
whole time. 
SPEAKER5 4:14:52
With those two hits, and with 4s immediately dragon lancing this fucking thing through the 
SPEAKER3 4:14:59
wall, through its body, blowing a giant chunk out of the side of it, now it looks like it's barely holding onto this world. 
SPEAKER5 4:15:06
It's mortal coil is running out. 
SPEAKER3 4:15:08
Somebody spit on it, please. Insunghun, it is your turn. 
SPEAKER4 4:15:14
That bitch is running. 
SPEAKER1 4:15:17
Insunghun kinda keeps running until he reaches the edge of the hole that Jun-Nun went into, and he just kinda stops. And then he just stops. 
SPEAKER4 4:15:28
And then he just, uh, looks over the edge, looks back, and just kinda huddles against 
SPEAKER1 4:15:36
the wall, and kinda keeps listening to whatever's going on out there. 
SPEAKER5 4:15:41
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 4:15:42
On that note, Jun-Nun, what would they hear? 
SPEAKER3 4:15:49
You're in combat, but just barely. What would Insunghun be hearing coming from the hole that leads further into the nightmare? 
SPEAKER2 4:15:58
What would Jun-Nun be hearing? You'd be hearing the sounds of the grapefruit video. Jun-Nun, you're muted by BT dubs. 
SPEAKER7 4:16:01
I haven't gotten to do anything, so, nothing. 
SPEAKER1 4:16:02
Oh, well. 
SPEAKER2 4:16:03
It's, eerily quiet. 
SPEAKER3 4:16:04
I have been sitting here. 
SPEAKER5 4:16:05
I'm sorry, okay? 
SPEAKER2 4:16:06
I'm trying to resolve one combat before I start another. I just wanted to let my mastiffs out of the way. Well, that's good. 
SPEAKER1 4:16:09
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER2 4:16:13
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 4:16:14
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER2 4:16:15
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 4:16:16
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER1 4:16:17
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 4:16:19
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER5 4:16:20
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER2 4:16:21

SPEAKER5 4:16:22
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 4:16:24
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER1 4:16:25
I just wanted to let my mastiffs out of the bag before they died. 
SPEAKER5 4:16:30
We'll get there. 
SPEAKER3 4:16:32
We'll get there, I promise. 
SPEAKER5 4:16:36
Maybe not right now, but we'll get there. 
SPEAKER3 4:16:39
That passes in Sung-Hung's turn. 
SPEAKER1 4:16:43
Gizzard, you're up. 
SPEAKER3 4:16:44
And no, these are aberrations. 
SPEAKER4 4:16:46
Um, Gizzard's gonna go for a two for one. 
SPEAKER2 4:16:53
How fucked up am I? 
SPEAKER4 4:16:55
Oh, pretty fucked up. 
SPEAKER3 4:16:56
Like... Just sneeze on it, Gizzard. 
SPEAKER1 4:16:58
Sneeze on it, and it will die of a bacterial meningitis. Like, if I sneezed on it, would it die? No. Damn. But if you hit it with anything that does a concerted amount of damage, you'd probably 
SPEAKER4 4:17:03
kill it. 
SPEAKER3 4:17:04
Fine. 
SPEAKER5 4:17:05
Damn. Uh... Yeah, I'll just shock and grasp this John one more time. 
SPEAKER3 4:17:08
Alright, bet. Fuck. 
SPEAKER4 4:17:10
Does an eleven hit? 
SPEAKER2 4:17:11
I'm gonna go for a three. I'm gonna go for a three. 
SPEAKER3 4:17:13
I'm gonna go for a three. 
SPEAKER2 4:17:14
I'm gonna go for a three. 
SPEAKER4 4:17:15
I'm gonna go for a three. I'm gonna go for a three. 
SPEAKER2 4:17:17
I'm gonna go for a three. I'm gonna go for a three. 
SPEAKER3 4:17:19
No. 
SPEAKER2 4:17:20
What? It has an armor class of twelve. 
SPEAKER4 4:17:22
Ah! 
SPEAKER2 4:17:23
God! Fuck! You stupid little bitch! Just die! Hey, that's it. Gonna hold it up to my neck. 
SPEAKER4 4:17:34
Oh, I'm gonna die! Oh, fuck. 
SPEAKER2 4:17:37
I'm gonna die! 
SPEAKER4 4:17:38
Oh, fuck. 
SPEAKER2 4:17:39
I'm gonna die! Fuck. 
SPEAKER1 4:17:41
Fuck. 
SPEAKER3 4:17:42
Fuck. 
SPEAKER2 4:17:43
Fuck. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Fuck. 
SPEAKER4 4:17:47
Oh, fuck. 
SPEAKER2 4:17:48
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. 
SPEAKER4 4:17:50
Oh, fuck. 
SPEAKER2 4:17:51
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. 
SPEAKER4 4:17:53
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. 
SPEAKER2 4:17:55
Oh, fuck. Fuck. 
SPEAKER3 4:17:57
Out of the way. 
SPEAKER5 4:17:58
Oh my goodness. 
SPEAKER2 4:17:59
So I'm gonna get that guard up. 
SPEAKER1 4:18:00
All right. 
SPEAKER4 4:18:01
Uh, that's it right there. 
SPEAKER1 4:18:02
And then I'm just gonna hook the other wall. 
SPEAKER5 4:18:03
Guys? 
SPEAKER3 4:18:04
Guys? Guys? 
SPEAKER1 4:18:06
Guys?! 
SPEAKER5 4:18:07
Guys?! Why, oh, my God. Oh my god, you little bitch! Oh, fuck, Jesus Christ! 
SPEAKER2 4:18:11
Hey! Wait, you got a letter from the PJ 의�, so that just texted me to come straight here at the door. 
SPEAKER7 4:18:14
Hey! 
SPEAKER3 4:18:15
Hey! 
SPEAKER1 4:18:16
dif you know who you were meeting yesterday? 
SPEAKER5 4:18:17
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I think you have a Ya persistence as a애 booster. It is you and the Mimic having a pissing contest. And the Mimic is like an eighth of the size of you. Meanwhile, Michi is soloing... 
SPEAKER3 4:18:29
Is basically soloing a Roper. 
SPEAKER4 4:18:32
With force. 
SPEAKER5 4:18:35
Anyway. 
SPEAKER3 4:18:36
That's its turn. 
SPEAKER5 4:18:37
Michi, you're up. 
SPEAKER4 4:18:41
I ran out of spells. 
SPEAKER1 4:18:42
I kinda wanna heal this Mimic. I swear to god. Okay, Michi is gonna swipe at this thing 
SPEAKER5 4:18:49
once fucking more. You know what? 
SPEAKER7 4:18:53
Yeah, let's just go ahead and swipe at this thing 
SPEAKER3 4:18:55
once fucking more. 
SPEAKER4 4:18:57
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. It's like a board to the Boreal Valley. 
SPEAKER1 4:19:12
A fucking 13. I don't think that hits. But we're gonna use Lucky once again 
SPEAKER3 4:19:17
and roll that shit once. 
SPEAKER4 4:19:19
Once more. 
SPEAKER6 4:19:19
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 4:19:26
Can't see. 
SPEAKER7 4:19:26
That's a 20 fucking 3. 
SPEAKER3 4:19:28
That'll hit. Cool. 
SPEAKER7 4:19:31
We're gonna attack damage now. 
SPEAKER1 4:19:33
Thank you very much. 
SPEAKER7 4:19:35
Or no, we're rolling for damage. 
SPEAKER1 4:19:38
Boom-ba-da-boom. 
SPEAKER2 4:19:41
Roll an additional fucking 1d6 
SPEAKER1 4:19:43
just for the weapon alone. That's a 3 on top of that, so... 
SPEAKER2 4:19:48
That's 6. 
SPEAKER1 4:19:50
Let's see. Roll once again for 
SPEAKER7 4:19:53
my opportunity to attack with Giant Smite. 
SPEAKER1 4:20:00
Making it a 12. And because I forgot that Bless is actually on this potion, 
SPEAKER7 4:20:05
then I get to roll 1d4. 
SPEAKER3 4:20:07
I forget a lot of things today. 
SPEAKER5 4:20:08
The 1d4 was to hit. 
SPEAKER7 4:20:10
No, 1d4 is with the Bless potion 
SPEAKER3 4:20:13
from Heroism. Bless buffs your ability to hit. It buffs checks. 
SPEAKER2 4:20:18
It buffs your ability to hit. 
SPEAKER3 4:20:19
Not damage. 
SPEAKER1 4:20:20
Add the number to the attack roll. 
SPEAKER3 4:20:22
Which is the... Yeah, that's the attack roll, not the damage. 
SPEAKER7 4:20:25
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER3 4:20:26
The first roll is the attack roll. 
SPEAKER2 4:20:28
The second roll is the damage roll. 
SPEAKER7 4:20:29
So then leave it as it is and fucking take that 12. 
SPEAKER3 4:20:31
Well, how... 
SPEAKER5 4:20:32
How do you want to do this? 
SPEAKER3 4:20:33
How do you want to end this roper? 
SPEAKER7 4:20:35
Oh, we're finally fucking ending this roper. 
SPEAKER1 4:20:37
Michi is just gonna 
SPEAKER7 4:20:38
chomp this damn sword straight through its mouth 
SPEAKER1 4:20:41
up into its little brain. Holding it like a fucking kebab. 
SPEAKER3 4:20:47
You fucking... 
SPEAKER7 4:20:48
Finally. 
SPEAKER5 4:20:48
Elden Ring poise attack this bitch. 
SPEAKER3 4:20:52
And it is dead as it goes limp on your blade. 
SPEAKER1 4:20:56
The blood... The blood filling 
SPEAKER7 4:20:58
the various lace webbing 
SPEAKER2 4:21:00
that makes up its intricacies. 
SPEAKER3 4:21:06
As that turn ends, Fores, you're up. 
SPEAKER4 4:21:10
Can I hold the mimic up and say 
SPEAKER1 4:21:12
SHUT IT! 
SPEAKER2 4:21:13
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 4:21:15
Let's try it because I... I... 
SPEAKER3 4:21:17
I... 
SPEAKER1 4:21:18
I can put you to war now! Okay, so... 
SPEAKER3 4:21:20
Anyway, 
SPEAKER1 4:21:21
just keep an eye on the bazooka and just try to slow them down so... 
SPEAKER2 4:21:24
summertime to get them a couple of auctions. 
SPEAKER6 4:21:25
Honestly, 
SPEAKER2 4:21:25
it's been a while so, I don't know 
SPEAKER6 4:21:26
where they're at now 
SPEAKER2 4:21:26
so they ain't gonna be 
SPEAKER6 4:21:27
around yet but I'm assuming 
SPEAKER2 4:21:27
Sh Carbon is gonna... 
SPEAKER5 4:21:29
I don't know 
SPEAKER7 4:21:29
where they're at right now 
SPEAKER2 4:21:30
but I'm assuming 
SPEAKER3 4:21:30
they might be 
SPEAKER6 4:21:47
might be not, 
SPEAKER3 4:21:47
And that ends the combat up here. 
SPEAKER7 4:21:50
Can I take my sword and jiggle this fucking monster off into the bag I'm holding? 
SPEAKER3 4:21:56
Yes, you can. 
SPEAKER2 4:21:57
I've taken the whole corpse with me. 
SPEAKER7 4:21:58
Cool. 
SPEAKER3 4:22:00
Trophy. 
SPEAKER2 4:22:00
And this combat now ends, as your party is made one lighter. 
SPEAKER1 4:22:07
Hard! 
SPEAKER3 4:22:09
The corpse of Ord now lays where Insung Hong ditched it, in a bloody puddle of its own decaying viscera. A blank, open expression. Time for what? 
SPEAKER1 4:22:22
We could save him. 
SPEAKER3 4:22:24
Time, what exactly are you going to use? 
SPEAKER7 4:22:27
Should we save him? 
SPEAKER1 4:22:28
Yes. Fours? Bird? What do you think? Worth it? 
SPEAKER4 4:22:35
You've got like two seconds to bring him back. 
SPEAKER1 4:22:38
Bird's long gone. Bird's long gone. Ord's long gone. Dragonborn's gone. I'm right here. Bring him back! 
SPEAKER7 4:22:49
There'll be a price to pay. As Michi uses the scroll. 
SPEAKER3 4:22:56
Scroll of Revivify? That is correct. I gotta figure out how many turns since he died. 
SPEAKER4 4:23:06
Oh, we're only on round seven, actually. 
SPEAKER7 4:23:08
Yep. 
SPEAKER6 4:23:09
Yep. 
SPEAKER3 4:23:13
The scroll of Revivify that you have, does it specify any material? 
SPEAKER7 4:23:15
I believe it did not. But then again, I never fucking got it, 
SPEAKER3 4:23:22
because you don't know if I got it. 
SPEAKER5 4:23:22
I am working on the compendium, hold on. 
SPEAKER1 4:23:25
Wait. It just says Revivify, nothing else. Question. 
SPEAKER3 4:23:37
Yeah? 
SPEAKER1 4:23:38
Doesn't the bird have part of his body? 
SPEAKER3 4:23:42
No. 
SPEAKER1 4:23:43
Okay. So all of his body is, 
SPEAKER4 4:23:45
well, half of his body is there. 
SPEAKER2 4:23:47
Yes. 
SPEAKER1 4:23:49
Is it gonna bring him back as like... 
SPEAKER4 4:23:53
I can use mending. 
SPEAKER5 4:23:54
Only one way to find out. 
SPEAKER3 4:23:55
I can bring two halves of his body together. Do you use the scroll, Kaelin? 
SPEAKER7 4:23:59
Um... I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 4:24:02
What do you think, Jizzer? Should we just- DON'T HIT! It's not gonna help him, he's fucking eviscerated. 
SPEAKER4 4:24:07
Well, I don't fucking know how this shit works, just do it. 
SPEAKER1 4:24:10
Crawl through the body and grab the rest of them, hurry up. 
SPEAKER4 4:24:12
Okay, I- well, Michi's fucking doing whatever to bring him back. I'll go get the second half of them. 
SPEAKER3 4:24:21
Make an investigation check. 
SPEAKER4 4:24:22
Oh god, David, just let me have the body. It's dead. 
SPEAKER1 4:24:25
Didn't it just bite it off? 
SPEAKER6 4:24:27
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 4:24:27
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 4:24:28
As a cleric, can I do a medical check to see if it's even possible? 
SPEAKER3 4:24:31
I'm joking. 
SPEAKER5 4:24:32
Yes, you can retrieve the second half of the body. 
SPEAKER2 4:24:34
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 4:24:34
It is a very distinct pair of legs. 
SPEAKER4 4:24:36
It's like investigation isn't good. It didn't like swallow him. 
SPEAKER1 4:24:40
It just sort of like, nom nom nom. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 4:24:43
Because it's a bird. 
SPEAKER4 4:24:44
Okay. While Michi's doing whatever, I use mending on the two halves that was Ord. 
SPEAKER2 4:24:50
So the mending spell, as you try to cast it, it fails. 
SPEAKER3 4:24:53
It is not meant to mend organic flesh. However, Michi, do you cast the Revivify spell via the scroll? 
SPEAKER1 4:25:00
Jake, do you want to be brought back to the campaign or do you want to stay out? 
SPEAKER4 4:25:06
Man, Ord's dead, he'll do his thing. 
SPEAKER7 4:25:09
stormy voice That's not an answer, that's a non-answer. It's the- do you like- do you want to continue on or do you want to-? stormy voice It's the- the- the- the- the- the- the- the- theíre you're doing. stormy voice I don't want to bring something back if they don't want to play. 
SPEAKER3 4:25:15
The question is- 
SPEAKER7 4:25:16
I would be down. Cool. 
SPEAKER3 4:25:18
What'd he say? 
SPEAKER1 4:25:19
What's the question? 
SPEAKER3 4:25:20
Wait, what? 
SPEAKER7 4:25:21
No, he said he'd be down. The question- the question is, do you watch them specifically, is do you want to play 
SPEAKER1 4:25:27
Ord in this campaign still, or do you want to make a new character? I would be equally down to go either way. Bring back Ord! 
SPEAKER4 4:25:37
Gizzard likes Ord. I would be equally down to go either way. 
SPEAKER1 4:25:39
Bring back Ord! 
SPEAKER4 4:25:40
Gizzard likes Ord. I would be equally down to go either way. 
SPEAKER1 4:25:42
Bring back Ord! 
SPEAKER2 4:25:43
Gizzard likes Ord. Gizzard likes Ord. 
SPEAKER1 4:25:45
Ord's- 
SPEAKER7 4:25:46
I'm just- 
SPEAKER2 4:25:47
I'm just- 
SPEAKER4 4:25:48
Ornn's treated him like an asshole. Make your character- make your decisions in character, not as players. 
SPEAKER3 4:25:50
Quickly, I need an answer from everybody here. 
SPEAKER5 4:25:51
Ornn would be a little insulted if he, uh, had killed the last, like- 
SPEAKER3 4:25:52
You should put a timer in. Seven guys, and then- 
SPEAKER2 4:25:54
Just bring him the fuck back! 
SPEAKER7 4:25:55
Just left to die. Are you guys gonna be fucking idiots and run off on your own again? 
SPEAKER4 4:25:57
Just bring him back. Fucking- Then the answer is no. 
SPEAKER1 4:26:00
No, I don't think- 
SPEAKER4 4:26:01
I don't think you should be fucking idiots. 
SPEAKER1 4:26:02
I don't think you should be fucking idiots. 
SPEAKER4 4:26:03
I don't think you should be fucking idiots. What? 
SPEAKER2 4:26:05
Just- sure, whatever. 
SPEAKER1 4:26:06
Just bring him back. Come on. I don't play. We are here to survive. 
SPEAKER4 4:26:10
If you would like to get us killed again, then- 
SPEAKER1 4:26:11
Yes, yes, yes. 
SPEAKER7 4:26:12
Hurry up! 
SPEAKER1 4:26:13
Michi's just gonna look as the time goes on in her head, knowing it's like a few seconds off. Mhm. Just do it! 
SPEAKER4 4:26:19
What are you doing? 
SPEAKER1 4:26:20
I'm just- 
SPEAKER7 4:26:21
I'm just- I'm just- 
SPEAKER1 4:26:23
I'm just- I'm just- I'm just- I'm just- 
SPEAKER2 4:26:27
I'm just- 
SPEAKER7 4:26:28
I'm just- I'm just- I'm just- I'm just- 
SPEAKER3 4:26:32
I'm just- 
SPEAKER1 4:26:33
I'm just- I'm just- What do you want from me? 
SPEAKER3 4:26:36
Hmm. 
SPEAKER7 4:26:37
I want you to behave. 
SPEAKER1 4:26:39
For once in a place that's lethal to everybody. 
SPEAKER4 4:26:41
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. 
SPEAKER2 4:26:43
Of course. Fine. 
SPEAKER3 4:26:46
I use it, then. With mere seconds on the table- Because I did stop- start a minute timer. IRL. Ord, I need you to describe to me. what you are experiencing in your first few moments of death as you end that being called back to the mortal coil, to the material plane. What is your version of heaven, Ord? 
SPEAKER4 4:27:24
Well, I wasn't thinking about that. 
SPEAKER1 4:27:26
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 4:27:27
Yeah, let's see what goes down. 
SPEAKER2 4:27:31
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 4:27:31
Yeah, everything has gone dark, 
SPEAKER2 4:27:38
and it's just sort of a feeling of weightlessness, or it's just sort of spiritually, everything around is just black, blank, 
SPEAKER4 4:27:55
or it's like slowly sort of has the sensation of floating upwards, like laying on its own. It's like this bag, arms outstretched, and just floating up through this dark expanse. And then slowly, light begins to return to his eyes. Somewhere above them, a light source is floating towards. 
SPEAKER2 4:28:20
And he imagines the afterlife, the paradise, 
SPEAKER4 4:28:27
whatever it may be, 
SPEAKER2 4:28:30
and slowly, 
SPEAKER4 4:28:31
as the light gets closer and closer, 
SPEAKER2 4:28:34
he starts to hear the, 
SPEAKER1 4:28:38
at this point, well-known, 
SPEAKER4 4:28:40
bickering of a certain dragon and a certain tiefling. 
SPEAKER3 4:28:46
Goblin. 
SPEAKER4 4:28:46
Back and forth. Or goblin, I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 4:28:50
I'm tweaking. Or it's just racist. 
SPEAKER4 4:28:54
We'll figure it out. 
SPEAKER1 4:28:55
And slowly, 
SPEAKER4 4:28:56
it comes back to 
SPEAKER2 4:28:57
the, uh, 
SPEAKER4 4:29:00
the dank cavern that is not where he had anticipated being, 
SPEAKER2 4:29:07
having been knobbed in half, 
SPEAKER4 4:29:09
but now to be a seer. 
SPEAKER3 4:29:12
Ord, as consciousness returns to you, the kind of downside to all of the healing magic that goes into this also returns to you. You feel the excruciating pain as well, as all of your flesh regrows where it was bitten off and reattaches to you, your lower body. And then, 
SPEAKER2 4:29:34
nothing. 
SPEAKER3 4:29:36
A seamless resurrection. For the rest of you, Ord now lays on the ground, battered, 
SPEAKER7 4:29:44
bloodied, 
SPEAKER3 4:29:46
fucked up beyond all recognition. The great quantity of you all, with the exception of fours, pretty fucked up beyond all recognition. But the cave is quiet. At least, this part of the cave is. 
SPEAKER7 4:30:10
Well. 
SPEAKER4 4:30:16
Is Ord conscious? 
SPEAKER3 4:30:17
Ord is conscious. With one HP. 
SPEAKER1 4:30:21
With one HP. Let's go. On the condition, Ola, that you are resurrected, 
SPEAKER7 4:30:28
it is that you guys don't feel the pain. It is that you guys don't fucking get us all killed this time. 
SPEAKER3 4:30:32
Understood? 
SPEAKER2 4:30:32
Cool? 
SPEAKER3 4:30:33
Thanks. 
SPEAKER7 4:30:33
And Michi's gonna walk off to the crystal wall. 
SPEAKER3 4:30:37
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 4:30:38
That's where we'll end our session tonight. 
SPEAKER3 4:30:40
Aliana, I am so sorry. If you want to keep going, technically we can. I wanna keep going. 
SPEAKER5 4:30:46
You wanna keep going? 
SPEAKER2 4:30:48
I as well. 
SPEAKER3 4:30:50
Is everyone else good to keep going for a little bit? I'll keep going for a little bit. 
SPEAKER7 4:30:54
Um, yeah. 
SPEAKER1 4:30:56
I haven't too. I haven't either. I haven't either. 
SPEAKER4 4:30:59
I haven't either. 
SPEAKER1 4:30:59
I haven't either. 
SPEAKER2 4:31:00
I haven't either. 
SPEAKER3 4:31:02
I haven't either. 
SPEAKER5 4:31:04
But y'all can keep going. 
SPEAKER3 4:31:06
We're gonna keep going until we can find a good stopping point. 
SPEAKER2 4:31:08
It's pretty late. 
SPEAKER7 4:31:10
Can I, uh, break some of these crystals off the wall? 
SPEAKER3 4:31:12
You can. But first, before we get to that, we need to catch up with Aliana and the absolute fucking terror that she's about to have right now. 
SPEAKER1 4:31:22
You don't happen to have two Revivifyers, do you? 
SPEAKER2 4:31:26
Nope. 
SPEAKER3 4:31:27
Aliana! It's the Intellect Devourer's turn up first. 
SPEAKER5 4:31:31
You don't happen to have a Reckless Orbs. 
SPEAKER3 4:31:32
Nope. It's the Intellect Devourer's turn up first. 
SPEAKER1 4:31:34
It is going to use— 
SPEAKER5 4:31:36
Why is it pitch black? 
SPEAKER2 4:31:37
Because you guys don't have characters. 
SPEAKER3 4:31:38
Oh, that sucks. Uh, until you tell me your characters move down. But— Oh! 
SPEAKER7 4:31:47
What the heck? 
SPEAKER1 4:31:49
Did you... 
SPEAKER2 4:31:51
Ah, what the heck?! 
SPEAKER1 4:31:53
Um, yeah. Oh, there we go. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 4:31:55
You can move? Okay, cool. 
SPEAKER5 4:31:57
It is going to use a claw attack on you and then— 
SPEAKER3 4:31:58
attack on you and then it is going to use devour and select on you. I need to know does an 18 hit? Yes. I'll need to take 10 slashing damage. Okay. And then I will need you to do to do to do to do to make a intelligent saving throw. 
SPEAKER1 4:32:30
Nat 20 baby. Wonderful, wonderful. 
SPEAKER3 4:32:39
These boldfishes are delicious. Beautiful. That ends its turn. 
SPEAKER1 4:32:45
It is now yours. Jesus Christ, that's loud. I have not fought a single thing this this. All right. I have two mastiffs, but there's only one. I can place another one. I'm going to two hand blade staff that bitch. 
SPEAKER3 4:33:15
Oh, here it is. Here so you guys can see I will place your characters down, but you will not be able to move them. 
SPEAKER1 4:33:40
Oh, right. It recognizes the wall. 
SPEAKER2 4:33:44
That's what I'm talking about.

Anyone except for Jinune. 
SPEAKER7 4:34:29
All right. 
SPEAKER1 4:34:31
I get my mastiff's dark vision just so I can see when I look on them because when I click on them, I can't see. 
SPEAKER2 4:34:37
I. I. 
SPEAKER1 4:34:37
I. 
SPEAKER3 4:34:37

SPEAKER3 4:34:42
Two-handed blades whacked the… 
SPEAKER1 4:34:43
Blades whacked the Devourer. 
SPEAKER5 4:34:48
Okay, yep. A 21-wheel hit. 
SPEAKER1 4:34:52
Great. Cool. Wait, it was with a nat 20, so I get a... 
SPEAKER5 4:35:00
Was it with a nat 20? 
SPEAKER1 4:35:02
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 4:35:04
No, it was a 15 and a 6. 
SPEAKER1 4:35:06
Just kidding, just kidding. 
SPEAKER6 4:35:07
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 4:35:08
I read that wrong. I... 
SPEAKER3 4:35:10
Yeah, just kidding. Imagine, imagine gaslighting me like that. 
SPEAKER1 4:35:15
I didn't mean to. 
SPEAKER3 4:35:16
You blade staff this thing and you stab through part of its, like, what would normally be the frontal cortex, and kind of eviscerate one of the legs off of it. There's no sound, but you can hear additional scurrying in the distance in response. 
SPEAKER1 4:35:31
Ugh. He's literally gonna make that noise. Ugh. 
SPEAKER5 4:35:35
Ugh. 
SPEAKER2 4:35:38
Um... 
SPEAKER1 4:35:39
Does it, like, does it look dead? 
SPEAKER3 4:35:41
No. Oh, it's not dead. 
SPEAKER1 4:35:44
Okay. Then I'm gonna whack it again. 
SPEAKER3 4:35:46
Alright. 
SPEAKER1 4:35:48
Do it again. Because I get two attacks. 
SPEAKER7 4:35:50
Do it again. 
SPEAKER3 4:35:52
Another 13 hit. 
SPEAKER1 4:35:54
Or 19 hits. 
SPEAKER5 4:35:54
That'll do it. 
SPEAKER2 4:35:56
Roll some damage. 
SPEAKER1 4:36:00
A 7. 
SPEAKER3 4:36:03
Another 7 damage. It, it wiggles and squirms under you. But it is not dead. 
SPEAKER1 4:36:11
Ew. 
SPEAKER6 4:36:11
Ugh. 
SPEAKER3 4:36:14
There are various tendrils that exist that now float out from under it and wiggle in some sort of receptive manner. 
SPEAKER1 4:36:24
I wish Alf was here. Quick! Boys! Sick him! I don't know how the doggies attack him. 
SPEAKER5 4:36:38
Okay, so... 
SPEAKER3 4:36:39
Doggies? 
SPEAKER5 4:36:40
Dog. 
SPEAKER6 4:36:40
Dog. 
SPEAKER5 4:36:41
It is actually... 
SPEAKER3 4:36:42
I gotta give them a turn. Yoink. And yoink. And roll their initiatives. Yoink and yoink. Cool, cool, cool. 
SPEAKER5 4:36:51
One of them went before you. 
SPEAKER3 4:36:52
So, I'll let you take its turn first. 
SPEAKER1 4:37:04
I gotta figure out why it's flying auction. Then it is doing that. 
SPEAKER3 4:37:07
That's interesting. 
SPEAKER2 4:37:12
One he... 
SPEAKER3 4:37:13
Did everything except for me. 
SPEAKER2 4:37:14
Oh my god. 
SPEAKER1 4:37:16
You told me not to tell you. 
SPEAKER3 4:37:17
See babyונ? Wink! 
SPEAKER2 4:37:19
Watch where that€€h ball goes. 
SPEAKER3 4:37:21
I already told you something women knows. 
SPEAKER1 4:37:24
A 
SPEAKER3 4:37:26
No, R Aurora. 
SPEAKER2 4:37:27
No, it was not undy Robotnik. 
SPEAKER3 4:37:29
My後 Achlo system is broken over this thing. I just want to show you that R Auroraама, you don't need a human brain to become one, but with your last training and yourula brainковiťi, you won't do anything but stare deeply but pay attention. He's alone. but it's not dead. 
SPEAKER1 4:37:43
Damn it, thing! Oh. Damn it, thing! Why can't you just die already? 
SPEAKER3 4:37:50
Which now brings us to the next turn. I need to know Does a 15 hit you? 
SPEAKER1 4:38:04
No. 
SPEAKER3 4:38:06
Cool. Does a 22 hit you? 
SPEAKER1 4:38:14
Yes. 
SPEAKER4 4:38:15
Cool. Before we get to that 
SPEAKER3 4:38:16
Does a 21 hit one of your Mastiffs? 
SPEAKER1 4:38:19
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 4:38:21
Does a 14 hit one of your Mastiffs? 
SPEAKER1 4:38:23
Yes. Cool. 
SPEAKER3 4:38:27
As what was unseen but now is a familiar sight to you another stalactite formation begins to move. Do-do-do-do. 
SPEAKER1 4:38:41
Brother. 
SPEAKER3 4:38:43
As four tendrils each of them reach out towards you grabbing you and both your Mastiffs 
SPEAKER2 4:38:49
you are grappled. 
SPEAKER3 4:38:53
It will then use its reel 
SPEAKER2 4:38:54
on the closest thing it can see 
SPEAKER3 4:38:56
which is a Mastiff 
SPEAKER2 4:38:57
25 feet, so 
SPEAKER3 4:39:00
5, 10, 15, 20, 25. 
SPEAKER1 4:39:05
Jesus Christ. 
SPEAKER5 4:39:07
Yep. 
SPEAKER7 4:39:07
As one of your dogs 
SPEAKER5 4:39:08
you hear yip out in pain 
SPEAKER3 4:39:10
and then dip out in pain. 
SPEAKER6 4:39:11
And then dip out in pain. 
SPEAKER3 4:39:11
Disappear into the darkness. That's its turn. Next boyo's turn. 
SPEAKER5 4:39:26
It's going to do-do-do-do-do-do. 
SPEAKER3 4:39:31
It's going to try and use its claw attack on you. I need to know. Does a 14 hit? 
SPEAKER1 4:39:39
No. 
SPEAKER3 4:39:39
Okay. And then I'll need you to make an intelligent saving throw. 
SPEAKER7 4:39:45
Oh boy. 
SPEAKER1 4:39:55
That's 20. Okay. 
SPEAKER5 4:39:57
Good save. 
SPEAKER1 4:39:58
Good save. My luck's going to run out very soon. 
SPEAKER5 4:40:04
It is now doggo number two. Doggo number two 
SPEAKER3 4:40:07
is being gripped by a roper. It is grappled and cannot move but it does have its tail. It's attack. 
SPEAKER1 4:40:15
It will try to attack the grappler that is holding it. 
SPEAKER3 4:40:21
Okay. Go ahead. 
SPEAKER1 4:40:27
There's a 17 hit. 
SPEAKER3 4:40:31
A 17 does not. 
SPEAKER2 4:40:33
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 4:40:37
That's that one's turn. 
SPEAKER2 4:40:41
It is now doggo number two. 
SPEAKER3 4:40:42
This one is going to go ahead and move its movement. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 as a second intellect devourer 
SPEAKER7 4:40:50
comes out of nowhere for you. 
SPEAKER3 4:40:53
The additional scraping that you were hearing. And it will use... 
SPEAKER5 4:40:57
Let's see. 
SPEAKER1 4:41:01
Yep. 
SPEAKER3 4:41:01
You're within 10 feet. I need you to make another intelligent saving throw. 
SPEAKER1 4:41:11
Okay. Like I said. Seven. 
SPEAKER4 4:41:26
Cool. 
SPEAKER5 4:41:28
I need you to take 
SPEAKER3 4:41:29
seven psychic damage. And then... Is your intelligence score lower than eight? 
SPEAKER7 4:41:40
Eight or lower? 
SPEAKER1 4:41:45
No. 
SPEAKER5 4:41:47
Good. You avoid being stunned 
SPEAKER3 4:41:49
and with your intelligence reduced to zero. 
SPEAKER1 4:41:54
Let me try that one more time. 
SPEAKER5 4:41:56
You resist your intelligence being reduced to zero 
SPEAKER3 4:41:58
and being stunned. 
SPEAKER1 4:42:00
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER3 4:42:02
That's the same thing that happened to you last time you fought these. For context. 
SPEAKER2 4:42:07
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 4:42:10
We got it. 
SPEAKER3 4:42:10
Cool. The end... That one's turn. 
SPEAKER5 4:42:17
It is your... 
SPEAKER3 4:42:18
It is your first dog. Your first dog's turn. 
SPEAKER1 4:42:26
All right, buddy. I'll try and free himself to... Hmm. 
SPEAKER6 4:42:36
He, he. 
SPEAKER2 4:42:40
Nope. 
SPEAKER3 4:42:41
That's not my dog. 
SPEAKER2 4:42:42
That's... 
SPEAKER3 4:42:44
That's its action. 
SPEAKER7 4:42:47
You're up. 
SPEAKER1 4:42:51
I will try to free... Try to hit the grappler hitting me. Holding me. Eh, beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. That would be just a regular unarmed. 
SPEAKER2 4:43:10
Unarmed. You want to go to... 
SPEAKER3 4:43:26
I don't know why I'm in the middle of that. 
SPEAKER1 4:43:28
I know. 
SPEAKER2 4:43:31
B ros Итак. You know, like you needed help. Good job, buddy. Mm hmm. 
SPEAKER3 4:43:35
Mmm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 4:43:36

SPEAKER3 4:43:39
Hmm. you're having a difficulty seeing it you're being whipped around it's not a great day for you 
SPEAKER1 4:43:46
two nat 20s on my intelligence saving throws in a room i knew it was gonna happen yeah 
SPEAKER3 4:43:54
yeah which brings it to the roper's turn um it is going to decide that your dog looks quite tasty yep it's going to use its reel to bring it close within biting range it's going to use its bite attack does a 24 hit your mastiff yes it takes 25 points of damage and is killed immediately as it is eviscerated and then the rest of its body hits the floor with a wet thud in the distance you hear one and then a thud and so silence and the crunching of bone on teeth then it will also that was its real attack and its bite attack it has nothing else to use its tendrils on so it's going to end its turn it was the next intellect devourer the first one which used its claw on you 
SPEAKER5 4:45:01
does a 23 hit 
SPEAKER2 4:45:05
it's a large time 
SPEAKER1 4:45:34
so fun He just wants me to fucking die a slow, painful fucking death. What is this? 
SPEAKER3 4:45:46
Hey, man. 
SPEAKER5 4:45:47
You're avoiding your fate from last time. 
SPEAKER3 4:45:49
It is your second dog's turn, by the way. 
SPEAKER1 4:45:59
You can do it. You can do it, potty. You can do it. 
SPEAKER2 4:46:04
I'm not going to lie. 
SPEAKER5 4:46:12
With a natural one, no. 
SPEAKER3 4:46:13
It could not, in fact, do it. This one's dead. Back to the first intellect devourer. Up initiative. It's going to move up into your space. 
SPEAKER5 4:46:33
Use a claw attack on you, and then use 
SPEAKER3 4:46:36
devourer intellect. I need to know. An 11 does not hit, but 
SPEAKER5 4:46:39
make an intelligent saving throw again, please. 
SPEAKER2 4:46:49
Oof. 
SPEAKER5 4:46:51
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 4:46:57
That'll be a good 10 damage. And... 
SPEAKER6 4:47:02
And... 
SPEAKER2 4:47:03
And... And... 
SPEAKER1 4:47:03
The noon looks very tired, exhausted, and bloodied. 
SPEAKER3 4:47:09
And once again, you feel another gnawing presence at the edges of your mind, this time familiar. It wants what's in there. It must have it. 
SPEAKER4 4:47:17
It's going to get it. 
SPEAKER3 4:47:19
But you shrug it off, and your intellect is yours. Your first dog has their turn again. 
SPEAKER2 4:47:33
And you plunge into the sky. With the reactive weapon. 
SPEAKER3 4:47:58
Cons tiers and that ring signifies hip, hip tailored knee- franchise mirror casting. These tendrils have an armor class of 20, just like the Roper itself. 
SPEAKER1 4:48:01
Uh, can I... can I have the dog howl very, very loud? Isung-han is going to... kind of push back and just like huddle against the wall. 
SPEAKER7 4:48:51
Uh, and he's just kind of frozen. 
SPEAKER1 4:48:57
He's not sure what to do. Has everyone else like backed? 
SPEAKER3 4:49:01
Is he still in the room where the other combat was? The combats have not caught up to each other. We're still three-ish rounds apart. So in three more rounds, then time will be synced up and the combat upstairs will have ended from Junyun's perspective. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 4:49:21
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 4:49:22
He would just kind of be against the wall. 
SPEAKER1 4:49:25
He's kind of just freaking out. 
SPEAKER3 4:49:28
He's not sure what to do. He's just going to huddle against the wall. 
SPEAKER1 4:49:30
He's just going to huddle against the wall. 
SPEAKER5 4:49:31
He's going to huddle against the wall. 
SPEAKER3 4:49:32
If you huddle in the wall seeking any sort of safety as the world around you falls apart into this sudden chaos and death... 
SPEAKER2 4:49:40
Junyun, you're up. 
SPEAKER1 4:49:44
I'm going to try and break free from the tendril. 
SPEAKER3 4:49:56
That is a strength of 13. 13. 
SPEAKER1 4:50:01
I try and I very, very exhaustively try again with every fiber in my being. 
SPEAKER3 4:50:13
You also need to roll at disadvantage. 
SPEAKER2 4:50:14
I'm sorry. It's okay. 14 will not get you free. But if that is the rest of your turn, then you're free. You're free. You're free. You're free. You're free. You're free. You're free. 
SPEAKER3 4:50:24
You're free. 
SPEAKER2 4:50:25
You're free. You're free. You're free. You're free. 
SPEAKER3 4:50:29
You're free. You're free. You're free. 
SPEAKER2 4:50:32
You're free. You're free. 
SPEAKER3 4:50:34
You're free. But this is the rest of your turn. 
SPEAKER2 4:50:36
It is now the Roper's turn. It will use its reel on the Zeitgeist Roper. It will see its reel on the tittle. See? 
SPEAKER3 4:50:41
Roll the d6. On an even, it will hit you. On an odd, it will hit your dog. 
SPEAKER2 4:50:46
See? No increase in 
SPEAKER3 4:50:57
average health. Exactly. That's my cue. feet towards it, away from your dog. You now are in full view of this now familiar creature, one that unbeknownst to you had ended your friend merely seconds earlier, and you now stare at the corpse of your once friendly and helpful mastiff. It can't use its bite attack, it can't use its tendril attack on anything because there's nothing else, so that will end its turn. The first intellect devourer is going to try to use its claw attacks on... First intellect devourer is going to actually chase after you. 5, 10, 15. And will try to use its claw attack. Does a 21 hit? 
SPEAKER1 4:51:50
Yes it does. 
SPEAKER3 4:51:52
That'll be four points of slashing damage. And you know, a familiar story. 
SPEAKER1 4:51:58
Intelligent saving throw. 
SPEAKER6 4:51:59
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 4:52:00
No need. 
SPEAKER6 4:52:03
No need? 
SPEAKER1 4:52:03
Um, because I'm downed. Because I'm downed. 
SPEAKER3 4:52:05
You are downed. 
SPEAKER6 4:52:07
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 4:52:08
Okay. Janune is downed at zero hit points. 
SPEAKER2 4:52:16
Cool, cool, cool, cool. That changes things a little bit. Um... 
SPEAKER3 4:52:24
That's gonna end its turn. 
SPEAKER1 4:52:24
I was at half health when I came down here. 
SPEAKER5 4:52:29
Well you still have a dog. So the first... The other intellect devourer is going to go after your dog. 
SPEAKER3 4:52:33
That is now howling. It'll use a claw attack. Does a 11 hit? 
SPEAKER1 4:52:41
No. Cool. 
SPEAKER3 4:52:51
It will use devour intellect. I need your dog to make an intelligent saving throw. 
SPEAKER2 4:52:54
Oh. Oh. Oh. 
SPEAKER1 4:52:55
Oh. Oh. 
SPEAKER2 4:52:56
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. 
SPEAKER1 4:52:59
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 4:53:00
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 4:53:00
Oh. Oh. It's not gonna end well. 
SPEAKER6 4:53:08
Mmm. 
SPEAKER1 4:53:10
You like that negative four there? 
SPEAKER3 4:53:12
It still beats it. 
SPEAKER1 4:53:17
Yeah, I got very lucky. 
SPEAKER5 4:53:20
We'll see if it's lucky again. What's the dog's intelligence score? 
SPEAKER1 4:53:25
Uh... 12. No, sorry. Three. Three. 
SPEAKER3 4:53:30
As a... Okay, hold on. Yep, that's a three. Your dog is stunned and its intelligence resutes to zero. 
SPEAKER2 4:53:39
In Songhang, the howling gets more desperate and desperate and strained and then all of 
SPEAKER3 4:53:47
a sudden, silence. 
SPEAKER1 4:53:49
He kind of gets sucked into the noises. He's kind of sprawling in them and then he kind of flinches. As it cuts off. 
SPEAKER3 4:54:00
And... He kind of stands up again, and like looks back down. Can he see the bottom at all? 
SPEAKER4 4:54:03
Oh, yeah, you can see the bottom from here. 
SPEAKER2 4:54:04
Oh, what... What does he see? 
SPEAKER3 4:54:06
Like, can he see what all's happening? 
SPEAKER1 4:54:07
Mmm... They've moved a bit forward. What you can probably see is the end, the ass end of one dog. That's the dog? 
SPEAKER5 4:54:11
That's the dog? 
SPEAKER3 4:54:12
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 4:54:13
I think it's the dog. I think it's the dog. Alright. Alright. 
SPEAKER3 4:54:17
So, what's the dog's intelligence score? 
SPEAKER1 4:54:18
Ah, it's the dog. 
SPEAKER6 4:54:19
It's coming. 
SPEAKER3 4:54:20
I've never seen a dog like that before. 
SPEAKER5 4:54:21
I mean, I think it's the dog. 
SPEAKER2 4:54:22
I mean, I've never seen a dog like this before. 
SPEAKER3 4:54:23
What you can probably see is the ass end of one dog. 
SPEAKER1 4:54:30
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 4:54:32
And... 
SPEAKER7 4:54:33
Like, can I tell him? 
SPEAKER1 4:54:36
Because he's stunned. And brain dead. Just like the noon ones. 
SPEAKER6 4:54:41
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 4:54:42
Oh. Would he see any intellect devourers at all or no? 
SPEAKER3 4:54:47
Not from your angle. No. 
SPEAKER1 4:54:52
Okay. Um. 
SPEAKER7 4:54:57
He's gonna kinda... 
SPEAKER1 4:55:00
Call out down there. 
SPEAKER2 4:55:06
And... 
SPEAKER1 4:55:07
Just in the voice of, like, a distraught woman. Call, like, what happened? 
SPEAKER3 4:55:14
You receive no response. 
SPEAKER1 4:55:17
He's gonna kinda just back away. 
SPEAKER2 4:55:22
Just unknowingly. 
SPEAKER1 4:55:23
Unsure of what to do. 
SPEAKER3 4:55:26
Alright. That brings us to the Mastiff's turn. Mastiff is... 
SPEAKER2 4:55:29
Stunned. 
SPEAKER5 4:55:32
Janoon! 
SPEAKER3 4:55:32
Make your first death saving throw. 
SPEAKER1 4:55:36
What? 
SPEAKER2 4:55:37
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
SPEAKER1 4:55:41
Whoop-whoop! 
SPEAKER3 4:55:43
Janoon, may we have a memory... That flashes as you pass closer to the end. 
SPEAKER1 4:55:53
Janoon... Lived a very boring life. That's why he decided to go... On his lone summoning adventure. So when he thinks of memories... 
SPEAKER2 4:56:07
The... 
SPEAKER1 4:56:09
The best memories that come up... Well... Very... Chaotic and... 
SPEAKER4 4:56:19
Annoying. 
SPEAKER1 4:56:21
His best memories were served by... The Mastiff. 
SPEAKER3 4:56:25
So... 
SPEAKER1 4:56:26
The first memory that comes up... Is... His meeting... Them at... 
SPEAKER4 4:56:30
Um... 
SPEAKER2 4:56:31
With the... I don't remember the name of that place... 
SPEAKER1 4:56:33
The little town. 
SPEAKER2 4:56:34
The sound of, uh... 
SPEAKER1 4:56:35
The sound of... 
SPEAKER2 4:56:36
The sound of... 
SPEAKER1 4:56:37
Salamander Springs? 
SPEAKER4 4:56:38
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 4:56:39
Them meeting at Salamander Springs and... Kinda learning the situation... And learning the story... 
SPEAKER7 4:56:42
And then... And then... 
SPEAKER2 4:56:44
And then... 
SPEAKER3 4:56:45
And then... 
SPEAKER1 4:56:46
And then... And then... And then... And then... 
SPEAKER2 4:56:50
And then... 
SPEAKER1 4:56:51
And then... 
SPEAKER7 4:56:52
The game mech Carrie! 
SPEAKER1 4:56:53
Yep. 
SPEAKER2 4:56:54
Ah, I don't know... Uh, he told you a lot, he might be trying tolijk this side of things. He told me Yeah. Um... And then, I thought it might be cool just to bare a bit... Yeah... 
SPEAKER3 4:57:00
And then, the rest of these days... 
SPEAKER1 4:57:01
At the littleーホ 
SPEAKER2 4:57:02
Mm... Our 15 helps us out, um... 
SPEAKER3 4:57:04
I think aesseM 
SPEAKER2 4:57:19
Like some marinated ground... 
SPEAKER3 4:57:21
Let's see, who's up next? It is the Roper. The Roper, seizing the opportunity, uses its reel on the other Mastiff. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. And end its turn there, as it sees that all of its prey, its next meal, is accounted for. 
SPEAKER2 4:57:47
The next Incollect Devourer leaves off where you don't know. 
SPEAKER3 4:58:03
Most likely to fetch someone more capable of using you. Actually, wait a minute, hold on, nope nope nope nope. I know what I was going to do, I kind of forgot. 
SPEAKER2 4:58:16
This next one is going to use... I need to look something up real quick. 
SPEAKER3 4:58:36
Oh, what you're trying to do? 
SPEAKER2 4:58:41
Yep. 
SPEAKER1 4:58:42
I see right through you. 
SPEAKER2 4:58:45
Yep. 
SPEAKER5 4:58:46
Please roll an intelligence saving throw for the Mastiff. 
SPEAKER2 4:58:51
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 4:58:52
I don't see right through you, I guess. 
SPEAKER2 4:59:01
Cool, cool, cool. 
SPEAKER3 4:59:08
The Dilettant Select Devourer, and you don't see this, you are unconscious, but the Mastiff knows. The Mastiff feels its entire mind and presence consumed as the Intellect Devourer teleports and switches with its brain. The Mastiff springs back into motion, but it is not the Mastiff you knew. 
SPEAKER2 4:59:34
Still grappled though. Cool. Very cool. I'm going to go back to the Mastiff. Very cool. Very cool. 
SPEAKER3 4:59:49
And then, since it's on the Mastiff's turn, the Mastiff is kind of like dead. So we're going to remove this combatant. 
SPEAKER2 5:00:06
So it was Roper, Intellect Devourer, that got the Mastiff. 
SPEAKER3 5:00:13
Janune, make your second death saving throw, please. Whoop whoop. 
SPEAKER1 5:00:17
May we have a memory this time that pulls you back from the brink of death. 
SPEAKER2 5:00:20
Memory. Probably have to say, when... When... 
SPEAKER3 5:00:24
When... 
SPEAKER5 5:00:25
When... 
SPEAKER3 5:00:26
When... 
SPEAKER2 5:00:27
When... When... When... When... When... 
SPEAKER1 5:00:32
When... 
SPEAKER2 5:00:33
When... When... When... 
SPEAKER1 5:00:36
When... 
SPEAKER2 5:00:37
When... 
SPEAKER1 5:00:38
When... When... 
SPEAKER2 5:00:40
When... 
SPEAKER1 5:00:41
When... Then... 
SPEAKER2 5:00:43
Yeah. Then... 
SPEAKER1 5:00:45
I'm just going to go individually here. 
SPEAKER3 5:00:50
And I'll get some appropriate music for this as well. 
SPEAKER2 5:00:58
Mm... Nope, that's not the right one. But I had... Oh. 
SPEAKER7 5:01:11
What exactly is a hit die? 
SPEAKER2 5:01:28
Hello? 
SPEAKER5 5:01:29
Yeah? What exactly is a hit die? 
SPEAKER7 5:01:32
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:01:33
A hit die is, like, as far as re-rolling on a short rest? 
SPEAKER7 5:01:39
Uh, no. No, it's just hit die. 
SPEAKER1 5:01:49
It's for how many HP you recover during a short rest. 
SPEAKER5 5:01:53
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:01:55
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:01:56
Because you have to spend them. 
SPEAKER7 5:02:10
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool. 
SPEAKER6 5:02:11
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 5:02:11
One sec, one sec. You can ignore me, actually. 
SPEAKER1 5:02:18
Ignore you as I'm just going? 
SPEAKER5 5:02:20
Uh, yes. 
SPEAKER3 5:02:21
Describe your memory, please. 
SPEAKER1 5:02:22
I don't think of a lizard. The, uh, the odd, seemingly evil lizard man that he had met. 
SPEAKER6 5:02:41
Yeah. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:02:41
In a jail. 
SPEAKER1 5:02:43
And was seemingly indifferent to, but then had this weird mix-up and turned into, you know, a neutral lawful for a while. Was what he had taken the law into his own hands and murdered him. 
SPEAKER2 5:03:02
We don't talk about that. Um. 
SPEAKER1 5:03:05
And then slowly kind of, you know, this guy's not so bad. Um. 
SPEAKER6 5:03:10
Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. 
SPEAKER3 5:03:11
Um. 
SPEAKER6 5:03:11
Um. Um. Um. Um. 
SPEAKER2 5:03:11
Um. 
SPEAKER6 5:03:11
Um. Um. 
SPEAKER1 5:03:11
Uh. 
SPEAKER6 5:03:13
Um. 
SPEAKER1 5:03:13
Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. 
SPEAKER2 5:03:29
Um. 
SPEAKER1 5:03:30
Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. 
SPEAKER3 5:03:39
Um. 
SPEAKER6 5:03:40
Um. Um. Um. 
SPEAKER1 5:03:41
Um. memories of him and JoJo posing during combat. And I'll save more memories, more good memories of other characters if I end up living. 
SPEAKER3 5:03:54
Good to know. I'm gonna take 30 seconds, I gotta pee. Right back. He really just put on fucking this. 
SPEAKER7 5:04:17
Alright buddy. 
SPEAKER1 5:04:20
I like how it's also such an intense moment and then he's like, actually wait, I have to go pee. 
SPEAKER3 5:04:31
I mean, I don't blame him. 
SPEAKER1 5:04:33
Oh yeah, no, like, makes sense. It's just the timing. 
SPEAKER3 5:04:41
See, I thought I had made the animation for my tags, but they're missing. 
SPEAKER7 5:04:49
What was it, doggy? 
SPEAKER3 5:05:04
One is that one, but the other one doesn't. I apologize. 
SPEAKER2 5:05:10
I've 
SPEAKER3 5:05:10
been holding that since halfway through the session. And also, things were happening. 
SPEAKER5 5:05:18
Alright. Also, I keep my headphones on so I could hear what y'all were saying. 
SPEAKER1 5:05:24
Oh. 
SPEAKER3 5:05:24
Mm-hmm. Oh my. 
SPEAKER1 5:05:26
I don't even remember what I said, to be quite honest. 
SPEAKER3 5:05:33
Damn. 
SPEAKER4 5:05:33
Didn't we just say that things were happening? 
SPEAKER1 5:05:38
Oh yeah, I didn't even say anything. This is dumb. 
SPEAKER5 5:05:40
Yeah, they did. 
SPEAKER1 5:05:41
Sorry, Tubman. 
SPEAKER3 5:05:43
It's okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:05:46
Oh, I remember I said something. I said you expect me to die. 
SPEAKER3 5:05:49
It's okay. 
SPEAKER5 5:05:53
You have 7 HP. 
SPEAKER3 5:05:54
I don't have 7 HP. Oh yeah, you have less than 7 HP. 
SPEAKER5 5:05:59
It is the Roper's turn. 
SPEAKER1 5:06:01
As your memory flashes. 
SPEAKER3 5:06:03
It cares not that the Intellect Devourer is in the dog. It does see the dog as a tasty snack, though. It reels it in. Mmm, yummy. 
SPEAKER1 5:06:13
Yummy, tasty. Yummy, tasty dog delicacy. 
SPEAKER3 5:06:18
It hits it with another bite attack. I assume a 26 and 25 points of damage will end the dog. Oh yeah. Yes. 
SPEAKER1 5:06:27
It's got an armor class of 12 and 5. 
SPEAKER2 5:06:30
The dog is also not in the dog's territory. Oh, yeah. It's got a armor class of 12 and 5. 
SPEAKER3 5:06:36
Oh, yeah. It's got a armor class of 12 and 5. Oh, yeah. It's got a armor class of 12 and 5. Oh, yeah. It's got a armor class of 12 and 5. 
SPEAKER5 5:06:49
An teve cinco, sir... 
SPEAKER1 5:06:53
Kleitità? 
SPEAKER6 5:06:55
I don't see one, Black Widow. 
SPEAKER2 5:06:58
What's the point of telling me if you're a detective? Could you explain what even a 우놅 pięk 기� multitask means in English? Uno. Uno no se. 
SPEAKER3 5:07:06
ت일리가 많이 발라졌는데. 
SPEAKER2 5:07:09
꼽 아니라. 
SPEAKER3 5:07:09
We're at two successes and one failure now. If you would, one more memory. 
SPEAKER1 5:07:19
Two stops, move to the bird. Also very peculiar. Doesn't speak much, which is very odd, because pinkies are known for making all sorts of noises. Even though those noises may not be their own. While his main intention was to make that kinky a very tasty dinner, that didn't end up happening. And it was very fun to play all those fun tricks on him, including shooting him out of a bag of holding and into a river because he thought the bird was very dumb. But after some time, he learned that the bird isn't just dumb, he's also stupid now. The bird is just very curious and um, sometimes you know, you're just a guilty cat. But, obviously. No, his favorite memory goes to um, going with Nsanghang to um, to the libraries and seeing the bird light up in awe over all the books. And, and go to the shopping center and getting him his um, what you can assume to be his first bag of holding. 
SPEAKER2 5:08:54
Hm. 
SPEAKER7 5:09:08
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 5:09:09
I'm going to go to the library. Okay. So, um, 
SPEAKER3 5:09:15
next turn is the roper. 
SPEAKER1 5:09:16
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 5:09:16
So, um, 
SPEAKER5 5:09:22
it is now round six. 
SPEAKER3 5:09:23
In Nsanghang, at this point time has caught up to the upstairs. The sounds of combat in the room over to your left, where Ord had just passed moments earlier, has subsided. There have been nothing but- there has been nothing but- there has been nothing but- there has been nothing but- there has been nothing barrier. There has been nothing but silence from below. You are unsure of the fate of Janoon at this point. Because you didn't really have actions in the previous combat, I'm going to ask, you have an opportunity to do something in this round. What are you going to do? 
SPEAKER2 5:09:55
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:09:57
Um, I guess he's going to look down and he can't see Janoon still, right? Does he even see the dog? 
SPEAKER7 5:10:05
Nope. 
SPEAKER1 5:10:07
Okay. Everything around him is quiet. 
SPEAKER5 5:10:12
Quieter. 
SPEAKER3 5:10:12
You are hearing an argument in the other room, but aside from that, nothing from below. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:10:21
But I guess, like, it's pretty obvious that combat is no longer happening in the other room? 
SPEAKER2 5:10:27
Yes. 
SPEAKER7 5:10:28
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 5:10:31
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:10:31
I'd say he probably kind of goes over to where the other room is. 
SPEAKER5 5:10:38
Okay. I'd say he probably kind of goes over to where the other room is. 
SPEAKER1 5:10:38
I think the others are at the start of the crystal hall. Kind of hallway or whatever little tunnel that kind of leads in. And, um, kind of like, to see what's happening and see if they notice him. 
SPEAKER2 5:10:57
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:11:01
I guess he probably sees Ord being healed at this time. 
SPEAKER3 5:11:05
Mmm. It would take a couple seconds, but yes. The beginning of the... It would be the beginning of the next round or the round after that. 
SPEAKER1 5:11:14
Okay. I'd say probably after the point where Ord gets, like, healed is where he, like, would kind of walk in. Or not just walk, but kind of run in and try to grab their attention and, like, direct them. 
SPEAKER2 5:11:27
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:11:31
After Michi heals Ord, um, or I guess revivifies Ord, I'm gonna... Walk over, being very careful to not get robered from somewhere else. 
SPEAKER4 5:11:42
And just, like, ask, how are you doing? You look rough. 
SPEAKER2 5:11:48
Oh, wait, one sec. 
SPEAKER1 5:11:56
Uh, Islhan will... Oh, sorry. Oh, I'm just gonna reach, um... Like, reach for my bag and be like, do you need anything? Are you... Do you need anything? Are you... Are you okay? I'd say Islhan is visibly very shaken. I mean, he's, like, very shaken. And seems, like, acknowledged. Like, he's hearing everything that Forza's saying, but he's also, like, a little bit, like... 
SPEAKER3 5:12:29
Kind of his attention is halfway elsewhere. 
SPEAKER1 5:12:31
Um, and he's gonna kind of, like, point down the hall. 
SPEAKER6 5:12:36
Point down the hall. Point down the hall. Point down the hall. Point down the hall. Point down the hall. Point down the hall. 
SPEAKER1 5:12:37
Uh, like, kind of anxiously, like, kind of frantically pointing, uh, to the direction Janude had gone, or where the hole of the tunnel is. 
SPEAKER2 5:12:48
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:12:52
Hey, Alin, are you here? 
SPEAKER7 5:12:54
I'm here. 
SPEAKER6 5:12:56
I'm here. 
SPEAKER7 5:12:56
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 5:12:56
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:12:56
I'm just double checking. 
SPEAKER2 5:12:58
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 5:12:58
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:13:00
Well, I asked you a question, and it was just silence. 
SPEAKER4 5:13:04
I didn't hear you. 
SPEAKER3 5:13:05
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 5:13:06
I'll hear your voice talking. 
SPEAKER7 5:13:07
I'm just double checking. 
SPEAKER3 5:13:07
Oh. 
SPEAKER1 5:13:08
Before... 
SPEAKER6 5:13:09
Before... 
SPEAKER2 5:13:09
Before... 
SPEAKER6 5:13:09
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:13:09
Okay. Yeah, no, when we cut back, I, um, basically asked, I mean, not quite, but how many hit points are you on? Like, what is your status level? 
SPEAKER7 5:13:20
Michi is pretty battered right now. 
SPEAKER1 5:13:24
Um, I'm gonna hold out a health potion to you. 
SPEAKER4 5:13:31
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 5:13:31
Oh. Are you sure? 
SPEAKER7 5:13:33
Are you sure? Are you sure? 
SPEAKER1 5:13:36
Are you sure? Um, it's probably going to be more indicators that's going to eat us, and I would rather we not die. 
SPEAKER7 5:13:46
Very well. Um. 
SPEAKER1 5:13:48
I don't know, actually, what health potion it is, because my inventory just says health potion because all my item descriptions got deleted. Um. So, yeah. I assume it's the standard one, I guess. 
SPEAKER3 5:14:03
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER7 5:14:04
In that case, Michi in return. 
SPEAKER5 5:14:06
Well... 
SPEAKER7 5:14:06
Hold on to this as well, and she's going to hand a Potion of Vitality to Follos. That way, it's a trade of equals. And then Meiji's going to... I guess... Should I pop off this potion now, you think? 
SPEAKER1 5:14:26
You look rough, and I'm basically fine. Because I'm not a run-up close fighter, because that will kill me. So, you're rougher than I am. Go for it. 
SPEAKER3 5:14:46
Before we get there... Janune. The Roper is busy eating both of your Mastiffs. It says that there's no threat around here. There's nothing it needs to kill. What is your next death saving throw? A Wub. 
SPEAKER1 5:15:15
Give us your final memory that brings you back to stability. It's basically like one of those happy ending montages... ...of all his favorite little memories! It starts with everyone! It first starts out though with Meiji. And how he's like, basically, like, who the fuck is this weird bitch? Ugh, very... He was very kind of... ...disgusted with her, not gonna lie. He doesn't really like the pee bitch she's got going on. But... ...only very recently in that cave... ...he learned that... ...the goblin ain't too bad. 
SPEAKER3 5:16:08
Maybe he should just... 
SPEAKER1 5:16:11
...keep his ears open a little more. A little more memories keep popping up. 
SPEAKER3 5:16:18
And that's where your fun little montage comes. 
SPEAKER1 5:16:20
With all his favorite little fun stuff. With all the fun little things that they did on the adventures. And all the fun little silly Meemi things. 
SPEAKER2 5:16:32
I'm not very good with imagination, I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 5:16:34
It's okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:16:35
Trust me for a long time. 
SPEAKER3 5:16:37
But Janoon, with those memories... ...you are stable. Your bleeding stops. And you will live... ...maybe... ...as you are inching closer and closer to being devoured. 
SPEAKER2 5:16:48
... You will succeed. 
SPEAKER1 5:16:52
You'll make it happen. 
SPEAKER3 5:16:56
Two brothers? 
SPEAKER2 5:16:58
Four boys? 
SPEAKER1 5:17:00

SPEAKER2 5:17:12
XX. 
SPEAKER1 5:17:13
E governor al خ yaz Secora. when I die. No. Because I have a horrible, horrible imagination. That's actually an autistic trait. If you didn't know that. Imagination is just not 
SPEAKER2 5:17:32
my thing. 
SPEAKER3 5:17:36
That's actually one of the questions I ask you. 
SPEAKER1 5:17:39
When you were a child, were you one to play 
SPEAKER7 5:17:42
imaginary? 
SPEAKER1 5:17:44
Or were you one to play the realistic 
SPEAKER3 5:17:47
stuff? That makes sense. 
SPEAKER1 5:17:49
They didn't worry like that. 
SPEAKER2 5:17:51
I just don't know. 
SPEAKER6 5:17:56
Well. 
SPEAKER5 5:18:04
Yes, it is an evil cliffhanger. 
SPEAKER3 5:18:05
We're all autistic here. But, we'll be back. 
SPEAKER1 5:18:14
Some of us more than others. 
SPEAKER2 5:18:16
Maybe. 
SPEAKER3 5:18:20
I am normal. And can be trusted with weapons. But, with that 
SPEAKER7 5:18:34
ending, 
SPEAKER5 5:18:35
how do you guys like the session today? 
SPEAKER7 5:18:38
Pretty good. 
SPEAKER1 5:18:39
Pretty good. Pretty good. Natali, you gypped that potion from the 
SPEAKER7 5:18:46
top shelf at the apothecary, right? 
SPEAKER1 5:18:49
Yeah. That was a security. I don't remember. Because I don't like... Okay, I came back and for some reason every single item description is gone. And I'm missing a couple 
SPEAKER7 5:19:04
items. That was the update Devin did to the B12 after I told him not to eat it anyway. 
SPEAKER1 5:19:11
So we have to kind of re-put everything back in since then and then maybe 
SPEAKER7 5:19:16
upgrade in the future again. But, if I do recall though, that potion was from the apothecary when we were kind of doing the whole dance around the store. 
SPEAKER3 5:19:25
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:19:26
That tracks. 
SPEAKER7 5:19:28
And I was like, how much is that potion? He's like a thousand something. And I'm like, mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 5:19:34
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 5:19:35
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 5:19:36
I think that was one of the big boy potions. 
SPEAKER3 5:19:41
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 5:19:46
I mean, I don't know. I just stole it. 
SPEAKER7 5:19:53
I think. 
SPEAKER1 5:19:54
He just fucking grabbed you. 
SPEAKER4 5:19:56
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:19:57
That was a good session. 
SPEAKER7 5:19:59
It was very interesting to see some of the things 
SPEAKER3 5:20:06
that I actually kind of dropped the ball 
SPEAKER7 5:20:08
forgetting what my spells did. 
SPEAKER2 5:20:09
Well, you know, sometimes it happens. 
SPEAKER3 5:20:16
I was kind of sidetracked with trying to fix my animation 
SPEAKER2 5:20:18
for my sword. Yeah, that's got to get fixed. 
SPEAKER3 5:20:24
But anyways, whatever you all think. That was really fun. Yeah, it... 
SPEAKER2 5:20:31
I don't think I was expecting it to go where it did. 
SPEAKER3 5:20:36
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:20:37
Yeah. Starting to spice things up. Wait, wait, wait. 
SPEAKER3 5:20:40
I'm starting to get a little bit nervous. 
SPEAKER1 5:20:41
I'm starting to get a little bit nervous. I'm starting to get a little bit nervous. I'm starting to get a little bit nervous. I'm starting to get a little bit nervous. Oh, wait. 
SPEAKER7 5:20:46
I have a question. 
SPEAKER1 5:20:47
Mm-hmm. So what were my little guys doing when they were watching everyone fight? Like, Alex... 
SPEAKER2 5:20:55
Oh, no. 
SPEAKER3 5:20:56
So they're there and they're willing to help. They were not going to be additional combatants. They know what was... Okay. So basically, DM to player. 
SPEAKER1 5:21:07
No, I know that. I was saying, like, what were they doing? Like, did they stand there and watch or did they leave? 
SPEAKER3 5:21:13
While you guys were fighting in the... 
SPEAKER5 5:21:15
First layer? 
SPEAKER2 5:21:16
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 5:21:17
Yeah. So they were trying to lead you to bypass that encounter completely. 
SPEAKER3 5:21:19
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 5:21:20
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:21:21
No, yeah. I know that part. 
SPEAKER2 5:21:23
But, like, once the guys were awakened, did they, like, scurry off? 
SPEAKER1 5:21:24
Yeah. No, yeah. I know that part. But, like, once the guys were awakened, did they, like, scurry off? Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:21:29
Once the guys were awakened, did they, like, scurry off? Um, Alf kind of stayed behind to watch. 
SPEAKER5 5:21:31
The rest of them very much split. 
SPEAKER3 5:21:32
And then, and then, once I left, did they go? Yes. 
SPEAKER1 5:21:34
What did they do? I see. Oh, my little Alf. 
SPEAKER3 5:21:37
And his little... 
SPEAKER1 5:21:38
His little hat. 
SPEAKER2 5:21:39
Oh, my Ilona. Oh, my Ilona. 
SPEAKER1 5:21:41
Oh, my little Alf. And his little... And his little... And his little hat. How... 
SPEAKER7 5:21:46
How exactly did this whole roper shit even start? Because I kind of, like, either blinked out there at that moment. I just know that Ord got yanked, but I don't know what triggered it. 
SPEAKER3 5:21:56
So, essentially what happened was Alf was trying to instruct everyone that this little passage here, right, the crystal one, that that was dangerous and to be quiet near it. Unfortunately... Uh, while the rest of you succeeded the stealth check, um, Ord did not. 
SPEAKER2 5:22:16
Oh. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 5:22:18
Ord alerted the Grimlock that was sitting, sitting here, and instead of everyone kind of, like, instead of staying back and using the narrow doorway technique of funneling 
SPEAKER2 5:22:29
them in, Ord decided to run into the room, uh, and try and take, take some swipes. 
SPEAKER3 5:22:38
And it's at that point that he got ganged up by the Grimlocks, but then the two ropers as well. 
SPEAKER2 5:22:41
Yeah, sure. 
SPEAKER3 5:22:42
Realistically, from a game design perspective, the way that this, this layer of the dungeon worked, right, is that the, everything that you guys had fought in the two sessions up to here was kind of your introduction to the things that are going to be in this first layer of the dungeon, right? Then the flumps were a either-or coin. Flumps by their nature as a creature are neutral and or friendly based on the mental state of the people around them. They are, uh, psychic siphons. Um... And they are intelligent. So that's why if your guys' mental state was like, alright, we gotta kill everything in here, they were gonna be hostile. No. No. 
SPEAKER1 5:23:22
Uh, Janune was more like, damn, I'm hurting a lot, and like, what the fuck, I just heard something fart. 
SPEAKER2 5:23:32
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 5:23:33
That's so unserious in a serious setting, kind of thing. 
SPEAKER7 5:23:36
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 5:23:37
But that's also part of the reason they didn't really talk to Jizzard or Ord. Uh, yeah, that makes sense. 
SPEAKER2 5:23:41
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 5:23:42
But what they did do was they were trying to lead you to the alternate passage. 
SPEAKER2 5:23:43
So the way that this map works, there are two ways to get to the same endpoint. 
SPEAKER3 5:23:44
There's the primary way, which has the blood trail and kind of the, you know, cookie crumbles, 
SPEAKER5 5:23:45
and that leads to the other entrance to this big atrium room. 
SPEAKER3 5:23:46
That would have gemeinsam lead you into the fact that you needed to... That would have basically started the encounter all at once, right? Yeah. And that's what I was trying to do. 
SPEAKER5 5:23:50
I'm trying to, you know, try to get to the other entrance. 
SPEAKER3 5:23:51
And that's what I was trying to do. I'm trying to figure out how to get to the other entrance. 
SPEAKER5 5:23:53
But the other entrance is like a little bit more difficult to get to, you know, like 
SPEAKER3 5:23:54
the other way around. Because once you finish the encounter, the other, the only other way out is the difficult terrain that is the crystal doorway. Uh-huh. If you followed the flumps or, you know, talk with them and ask them for help, they would not go to the other entrance. And so it's basically, like, you know, it's a little bit of a puzzle. But once you found the other entrance, that would have led you to the other entrance. Yeah. And that would have guided you to the other entrance. Yeah. So I think that's one way to get to the other entrance. Because once you've gone through the other entrance, there is another way out. And that's why I think that this map kind of has a ton of different implications for you. Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER2 5:24:10
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 5:24:11
You know, you can go through the other entrance all at once. 
SPEAKER3 5:24:24
know the alternate passage that is completely safe that loops around and brings you to the descent and then all you need to do is pass the stealth check or acknowledge that because of this narrow doorway you could just funnel the enemies in and kill them and then descend down to the next level so yeah that's how i designed this layer 
SPEAKER1 5:24:51
oh i mean that makes sense uh me out of character i'd assume that big not even just me on a character like me in character too just thought because in character we were like oh yeah we're gonna leave them that we were gonna leave them like actually like we did previously that that was gonna happen again and so i expected them to come down sooner or later and then i was like oh yeah we're gonna leave them and then i was like oh yeah we're gonna leave them and i'm like oh 
SPEAKER3 5:25:23
which is an assumption that totally totally holds out uh the other design and kind of i was talking about this before we started playing this dungeon is a lesson in pacing your characters are never meant to be able to run through all of this at once i honestly thought what would happen would be like that you guys would use in slung hung's orb and rest because you can get a long rest in that i didn't know that safe and uninterrupted that's what i was trying to tell that's why at the beginning of the session when she was like some note i said hey some notes this is a sphere this is a this is a bubble that is going to last for eight hours that will block anything else 
SPEAKER1 5:26:16
yeah and that's why songhwan wasn't leaving it for the whole combat was because like the second he leaves it disappears and i think i was kind of talking to myself out loud when i mentioned but 
SPEAKER3 5:26:28
that was just really quickly mentioning it um but yeah i think you better do that out of character 
SPEAKER7 5:26:34
because i i don't remember you going like normally you would say this area safe stay rest now or 
SPEAKER1 5:26:42
something like that you know i don't hear any of that yeah it was out of character and then um and i think he kind of left it as everyone else started moving on yeah i think he did try to get i think at least ord's 
SPEAKER3 5:27:01
attention at one point by like patting the ground and like making some noises but that they just like 
SPEAKER1 5:27:07
uh orden just walked away to an area while everyone else started uh going onward to follow the plumps 
SPEAKER7 5:27:16
yeah it's like you're just making sound that the wide walk-ins of each of your 
SPEAKER2 5:27:21
not did not have any attention 
SPEAKER7 5:27:25
that makes sense like yeah we hear the thudding getting out of here oh my gosh they're so cute 
SPEAKER1 5:27:37
the flumps yeah you just look at pictures yeah and now i'm imagining off with this little desert hat 
SPEAKER3 5:27:51
it's beautiful 
SPEAKER1 5:27:54
will you do anything with them like i feel like there has to be some sort of you could sell it on 
SPEAKER4 5:27:58
the black market or like sell it to an alchemist i have no clue but i'm gonna bring it back and say 
SPEAKER1 5:28:03
this is what your bastards are dealing with hey aliana i have something for you i oh i put it in character art but i'm gonna draw elf yeah i just saw that one and these two combat encounters did we level up? 
SPEAKER7 5:28:19
did we level up? 
SPEAKER3 5:28:22
it's got a bit more to go this isn't the end of the dungeon this is far from the end of the dungeon 
SPEAKER7 5:28:30
i mean killed a few things getting here 
SPEAKER1 5:28:35
quite a few things in fact 
SPEAKER2 5:28:43
it's been a long time since we've all done that 
SPEAKER1 5:28:45
oh 
SPEAKER3 5:28:51
same it 
SPEAKER1 5:29:04
interesting but going on at the toothless almost 
SPEAKER3 5:29:09
much too much 
SPEAKER7 5:29:11
the well 
SPEAKER3 5:29:18
so i hadn't really taken a two- sudden turnaround from monster Учистить, 好, 
SPEAKER7 5:29:19
one of those interesting things to watch, but never get put to practice. 
SPEAKER2 5:29:27
I don't know who would find this interesting to watch. 
SPEAKER1 5:29:31
I feel like we go over the same stuff every time. Like, every session is like... People are doing crazy things. We almost die. It ends. We come back. We heal up. We do more crazy things. We almost die. It's just the concept of every popular cartoon TV show. Yeah, but I feel like a lot of the stuff that we keep bumping into is like... A lack of common sense. But we also have characters that lack common sense, so it makes sense. I don't know, I... Yeah, I don't know. I feel like it's the- The- The line of like... Like, for me, as my paranoid rogue character, like... Is there a reason, really, why my character would be sticking around combat encounters when they look like they're going badly? Or like, would my rogue be trying to save their own skin? Probably the latter. But there's a suspension of disbelief that's involved because it's a D&D game, where you're like, Hey, technically it's not like 100% in line with the character, but like, because we're a party and we do battles together and you know, it's just- How the D&D do. Like, there is that suspension of disbelief. 
SPEAKER4 5:30:52
Like, yeah, yeah, well actually, even though the character probably in that situation would actually just, you know, fucking leave, you're gonna stay and fight and whatever. 
SPEAKER1 5:30:59
And I think it's kind of a thing of like that, where it's like, yes, there are characters without common sense, but when it's just a kind of ad nauseum of like... 
SPEAKER3 5:31:05
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:31:06
This, again. Like, at a certain point, there has to be that same level of suspension of disbelief of like, okay, the character, you know, is like this, but for the sake of the fact that it's a D&D game... 
SPEAKER4 5:31:18
We're gonna not do that. 
SPEAKER1 5:31:21
Maybe we need to get a spray bottle or a taser and just tase them every time we have anything from something. 
SPEAKER3 5:31:27
I think enforceable character punishments should be a thing if that's a game. 
SPEAKER1 5:31:33
That's what I'm saying, a spray bottle. Like, no, bad. Bad. 
SPEAKER3 5:31:40
Well, I'm still waiting on one of you to make a, you know, chastity cage. 
SPEAKER1 5:31:43
I've been fucking trying to, but you wouldn't let me get the option. What? No! 
SPEAKER5 5:31:49
You guys just had a different quest to go on. 
SPEAKER1 5:31:50
I literally have fucking stuff to zap his little nuts into a fucking boomy and then he won't let me make it. Zap them into a what? 
SPEAKER7 5:31:59
Also, I need it fixed. 
SPEAKER3 5:32:02
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER7 5:32:04
Yeah, see. Then we don't have fucking people going, what?! 
SPEAKER3 5:32:09
You know, on the realm of like, there isn't a lot of things that tie the party together, both in roleplay, I think that's something that can be fixed. But also as a story. I mean, I'm not a big fan of the story writing thing. I'll throw something at you that'll be like, hey, all of you are in this shit together. Yeah, I just, I'm trying to make something that's good. There's a difference between writing that is okay and some writing that is good. And I'm an okay writer trying to make something good. 
SPEAKER1 5:32:36
Oh, I think it's really good. Like, the way you were narrating was really great. And like some of the fucked up shit you were saying was really good. I'm like, what the fuck? Where the fuck is he getting his material? It's like, crazy, I wouldn't have thought of that, but it's good. 
SPEAKER7 5:32:50
Yeah, you know, really good. 
SPEAKER1 5:32:52
I don't think the issue that we're running into is like, I think, I mean, I think we did have issues of not necessarily coming together as a party. And I think we're kind of past that at this point. Like, we're definitely more together than we were. And I also don't think it has anything to do with the way that you're writing stuff. 
SPEAKER4 5:33:09
I think it's just like, like the lack of common sense. 
SPEAKER3 5:33:17
Yeah, I can't really fix that. 
SPEAKER1 5:33:21
Yeah, well, I think like, like simple example, the like, everybody saying shush and then be like, I'm gonna scream like. Yeah, that was mildly annoying. It feels like it's stuff like that that we're running into now more than anything of like. Yeah, I don't know if it makes sense, but at the same time. 
SPEAKER3 5:33:47
And I think that's at that point, I think that could be. 
SPEAKER1 5:33:49
That suspension of disbelief that I'm talking about where it's like, okay, we get that your character would do this, but like, for the sake of everybody else who's going to get stuck in the four hour combat encounter, like, no, it doesn't happen. No, you don't do that. 
SPEAKER3 5:34:03
At the same point, I do think it's a good opportunity for you to have that development in character and be like, Jizzard, listen, chief, you're not the only one risking your life out there. And I think the perfect opportunity for that just arrived with Ord fucking dying. I don't think so. 
SPEAKER6 5:34:15
I don't think so. 
SPEAKER2 5:34:15
I don't think so. 
SPEAKER6 5:34:15
I don't think so. I don't think so. 
SPEAKER7 5:34:15
I don't think so. 
SPEAKER6 5:34:16
I don't think so. 
SPEAKER7 5:34:16
I don't think so. 
SPEAKER6 5:34:16
I don't think so. 
SPEAKER7 5:34:17
I don't think so. I don't think so. Third encounter like that. And it's two for these two. Where we've had near death to death experiences. 
SPEAKER5 5:34:30
Don't be stupid. 
SPEAKER1 5:34:32
Don't try to get something killed. 
SPEAKER3 5:34:34
He also didn't have a reason to care about any of yourャ characters early on. That's the other thing, the character development of a character, another character nearly dying only really matters if his character cares about them. Well, here's the thing. 
SPEAKER1 5:34:48
I feel like Nietzsche even asked him, he's like, are you guys still going to do stupid stuff if I revive him? And he's like, well, and he's like, I'm not going to resin then. And he's like, okay, fine, whatever. But, like, clearly lying. 
SPEAKER7 5:35:02
There's a rule in most RP is value your life, and it's, you as a person rationally will never try anything that would get you killed. 
SPEAKER3 5:35:12
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 5:35:13
Like, intentionally try to get yourself killed. So I think in the aspect of doing something in RP, you shouldn't intentionally try to do something that you know will get yourself killed. Like, that doesn't make logical sense. 
SPEAKER3 5:35:29
But I do hope that... Oh, God, he's pulling out fucking wow. 
SPEAKER7 5:35:38
Nope. 
SPEAKER5 5:35:38
I'm glad that this session was still fun. 
SPEAKER3 5:35:41
I'm glad that things are getting better in at least some respects. 
SPEAKER7 5:35:45
We had a great time. 
SPEAKER1 5:35:48
Oh, yeah. I'm trying to... I'm hoping that the push for Junoon to kind of relationship build with Nietzsche isn't too forceful. I'm just trying to kind of get a little nudge in there. That's good. 
SPEAKER7 5:36:07
I think you're doing fine. 
SPEAKER1 5:36:08
I mean... 
SPEAKER5 5:36:10
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:36:11
I don't think it's too heavy-handed or anything. 
SPEAKER7 5:36:14
I think... At the point where we're both agreeing that we're trying not to die after watching you guys literally get maimed the first second I walk in is... Kind of coming to the general agreement that... Yeah, let's not be fucking dumb. 
SPEAKER2 5:36:28
Let's... 
SPEAKER7 5:36:29
Tread lightly. Let's make some smart decisions for once. It was something that I think Nietzsche was like, yeah, I like this person for that. 
SPEAKER1 5:36:36
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 5:36:36
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:36:42
I was trying to kill Jisoo at one point. 
SPEAKER5 5:36:44
I was trying, guys. I want you to know. 
SPEAKER1 5:36:49
Oh, yeah. I remember that. I remember at one point you were. That was a long fucking time ago. 
SPEAKER5 5:36:56
Well, no, even in this fucking session that Mimic rolled four like six consecutive times. 
SPEAKER1 5:37:03
Hey, I rolled a 16 for the first five turns and I couldn't hit shit. Why was... My turn consisted of... I'm going to shoot it. Roll a 16. Well, guess I'm not going to do it and there's literally nothing else that I can do. 
SPEAKER3 5:37:22
Honestly, I... There... Okay, there has to be... I mean, yes, there is more to this game than combat. There's a lot more. But it still surprises me that your class can't attack... 
SPEAKER1 5:37:38
It's because I took the alert beat. 
SPEAKER5 5:37:41
Right. And pretty much everyone who plays Rogue takes... 
SPEAKER3 5:37:44
Sharpshooter. 
SPEAKER1 5:37:47
Yeah, because I figured we're at a party. No one else is going to have whatever, which, you know, it works. We're not like... 
SPEAKER3 5:37:54
Yeah, you're not ever ambushed. 
SPEAKER1 5:37:56
I'm not surprised. 
SPEAKER3 5:37:57
You run to the ambush. 
SPEAKER1 5:37:58
And, yeah, exactly. There's no ambush. It's just, oh, look, that's the thing that's going to kill us. Runs over to the thing and tries to aggressively hug it. So, I don't know. I maintain that I like the alert beat and being able to go first pretty much every single initiative is handy because if I can actually hit it, and especially if I get sneak attack, I can do a lot of damage. 
SPEAKER5 5:38:21
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:38:21
It's just frustrating of, like... 
SPEAKER5 5:38:23
Yeah, and I do have some other... 
SPEAKER3 5:38:25
I also want to say, just some, you know, developer notes to the gaming community over here. I have some other encounters and things that I'm storyboarding out and such that are much less go-into-cave fight thing. 
SPEAKER7 5:38:40
I would like to see a lot of puzzles. I like puzzles. 
SPEAKER1 5:38:44
And shit like this would be fun to put things together. 
SPEAKER3 5:38:47
Of course. 
SPEAKER7 5:38:48
That's just me personally. 
SPEAKER3 5:38:49
Be careful what you wish for, but of course. 
SPEAKER7 5:38:54
Murder mystery. We've already worked on this one. 
SPEAKER6 5:38:57
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER7 5:38:59
I have a quest that I'm going to make and maybe submit it to you. You don't even get to fucking know what it is. 
SPEAKER1 5:39:07
Sure. 
SPEAKER3 5:39:07
I take input. We will see. 
SPEAKER1 5:39:13
We will see. 
SPEAKER3 5:39:13
But on the note, seriously, if you all have quest ideas and you're like, hey, this would be a fun quest or a fun flavor, give it to me. Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 5:39:23
And somebody quote that. 
SPEAKER3 5:39:25
Shut up. Shut it. Shut. Every day I wake up and I'm like, I'm not going to be jizzered today. 
SPEAKER1 5:39:41
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 5:39:41
And then I say something and it becomes out of context. 
SPEAKER5 5:39:45
And all of a sudden it's like, you've been jizzered. 
SPEAKER1 5:39:48
I mean, I feel like if you say stuff like, that's a good flavor, give it to me. 
SPEAKER4 5:39:53
That's like... 
SPEAKER1 5:39:55
Kind of breath up on yourself. We should make a game. Was it jizzered or was it someone else? 
SPEAKER5 5:40:06
Was it Discord or jizzered? 
SPEAKER1 5:40:08
I feel like that's kind of what we've been trying to do with the... 
SPEAKER3 5:40:11
Out of context. Out of context quest channels? 
SPEAKER1 5:40:13
I meant the... Trying to get the... I mean, not Kahoot, because that wasn't an ideal situation for doing it. But that, like, guess who said the quotes after they happened a little bit ago? 
SPEAKER5 5:40:25
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:40:26
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:40:29
Wait, you know what we could actually do? An easy alternative, possibly, alternative to Kahoot is... And it's like super simple and maybe not the best, but an idea. It immediately came to me. The person, like, hosting it or asking, like, reading the quotes could just scroll really high up to the point no one fucking remembers who said what. And just read them. 
SPEAKER4 5:40:54
And then we just guess. 
SPEAKER1 5:40:55
And then... Well... Yes. But also, like, going through in advance and picking out, like... Having a time period, whatever. Or even just, like, going back to all of them and picking out, like, these are the funniest. And then... So that way it's not just, like, the random... Random stuff. Because there's stuff in here that we put down that's, like, funny at the time. Yeah. But then it's not, like... It's not necessarily as funny when you come back to it months later. 
SPEAKER5 5:41:24
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:41:25
But it's also, like... It's kind of also fun to have the, like... Here's four options. Who do you think it is? So that it's... Your brain is stuck with those. It's not just, you know, come up with random people. It's, like, you know... There's four people. 
SPEAKER6 5:41:41
There's four people. 
SPEAKER1 5:41:41
There's four people. There's four people. What do you think is the most likely option? And, like, to have somebody go in and put down, like, this is who we think said it, I think is also good. Because there's an element of, like... Okay. This, like... 
SPEAKER3 5:41:55
Whose personality would say this? 
SPEAKER1 5:41:57
Let's find our random quote. 
SPEAKER7 5:42:02
Like... 
SPEAKER3 5:42:03
What is this? 
SPEAKER1 5:42:06
Luck edging? 
SPEAKER4 5:42:06
We're like, oh, who do we think said that? 
SPEAKER1 5:42:10
Who would use the phrase luck edging? 
SPEAKER3 5:42:11
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:42:13
Or I'll try to be safe and unloosed in the shower. You're like, hmm, who would say that? And to have, like, the initial... Which one was Devin? What? 
SPEAKER7 5:42:22
Say fucking safe and unloosed. 
SPEAKER1 5:42:24
That was not Devin. What? 
SPEAKER3 5:42:26
No way. 
SPEAKER4 5:42:27
It wasn't me. 
SPEAKER1 5:42:28
It was you. That was you. That sounds like something Koi would say. I feel like luck edging was country. Luck edging was Devin. What? Luck edging was Devin. Unloosed in the shower was Koi. But I feel like... If you have the initial, like, gut response of who is this, and then if you have that and, you know, a couple other people, and then the person that actually said it, I think that creates a really interesting situation where you're like, 
SPEAKER3 5:42:51
who do we think? Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 5:42:53
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:42:54
So I think it's fun to have the, like, curated ones, but then also, you know, here's four potential people. It's just Kahoot is very tedious to set that up for. 
SPEAKER6 5:43:03
Yeah. Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:43:05
But I think... Was it... Did Hunter say he was going to run the next one, or...? 
SPEAKER5 5:43:08
I think so. 
SPEAKER7 5:43:09
Oh. I hope. 
SPEAKER1 5:43:13
Because I can do it again. I just need to know so I can start. 
SPEAKER4 5:43:17
We need to have a prize pool for it, to be real honest. 
SPEAKER1 5:43:21
Well, the trick is, it's technically studyable. Like, you could theoretically go through and memorize all the clues. 
SPEAKER7 5:43:26
Yes. 
SPEAKER5 5:43:28
But, like, much like every Kahoot we've played as students, did any of us study for them? 
SPEAKER1 5:43:33
Yes. 
SPEAKER7 5:43:34
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:43:35
Okay. 
SPEAKER5 5:43:36
Never mind. 
SPEAKER3 5:43:37
I stand corrected. 
SPEAKER1 5:43:38
Y'all are built different. 
SPEAKER7 5:43:38
Some of the fucking ones were geology. They give you, like, five bonus points on your annual overall grade. Beautiful. 
SPEAKER5 5:43:44
What? You got ac... 
SPEAKER1 5:43:47
Have you not... You know, no, you study for pretty much everything, because then you get, like, 120% at the end of the course. Exactly. 
SPEAKER3 5:43:54
This makes me so angry. 
SPEAKER1 5:43:56
I mean... 
SPEAKER5 5:43:56
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 5:43:57
Cool. 
SPEAKER5 5:43:57
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 5:43:58
Clearly. 
SPEAKER6 5:43:59
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 5:43:59
One of the classes. I was going to say, when you're studying for the Ordovician's Fluvial Flow, 
SPEAKER7 5:44:05
you're kind of losing your mind, so I think you're going to want those bonus points. 
SPEAKER3 5:44:09
We didn't get bonus points for shit. 
SPEAKER1 5:44:14
But I got bonus points for figuring out how to use a semicolon, because nobody knows anymore. 
SPEAKER7 5:44:19
Nope. 
SPEAKER4 5:44:20
I'm pretty sure I would have blown a guy for bonus points. 
SPEAKER1 5:44:23
I got bonus points because it was a quiz of, like, pick out which of the proper uses and improper uses of the semicolon, and nobody else could figure out what it was. 
SPEAKER7 5:44:33
I asked me how to use one because I just fucking don't remember. I think I used it, like, three times. And I never did it again. 
SPEAKER1 5:44:40
It's such a useful punctuation, though. 
SPEAKER7 5:44:44
Yeah, well, you've read my papers, so fuck that. 
SPEAKER1 5:44:46
I would have committed heinous crimes. 
SPEAKER5 5:44:50
Heinous crimes. 
SPEAKER3 5:44:51
To get bonus points like that. 
SPEAKER1 5:44:55
I mean... Lapse in 120%. 
SPEAKER3 5:45:01
I don't think I've ever wanted to murder one of my friends so much after learning how that worked for you. 
SPEAKER7 5:45:09
So you're saying that you... 
SPEAKER1 5:45:11
Don't get me wrong, don't get me wrong. I do go through a lot of Red Bull, and a lot of worrying about how the grades are going to turn out. But, like, when you get... Even, like, for my Spanish class, it's like, oh, do this, like, you know, 20-minute presentation about whatever, and then you do it and you get, like, five bonus points. It's like, you might as well. Like, if there's three points, just don't sleep and just get it done. 
SPEAKER7 5:45:38
Yep. 
SPEAKER3 5:45:39
I want you to understand. In order to get bonus points in my major, right, traditionally speaking, you had to be... Not even sleeping with a professor would get you bonus points. 
SPEAKER5 5:45:54
Ask me how we know. 
SPEAKER1 5:45:59
The thing is, Devin... Did you sleep with one of your professors? All men? 
SPEAKER5 5:46:04
They are all men. We had a professor who, you know... 
SPEAKER1 5:46:08
And, like, 90% of, like, computers... 
SPEAKER6 5:46:09
And, like, 90% of, like, computers... And, like, 90% of, like, computers... And, like, 90% of, like, computers... 
SPEAKER1 5:46:09
And, like, 90% of, like, computers... Are, like, men? 
SPEAKER3 5:46:12
You ever hear the phrase, 20 bucks is 20 bucks? No. What actually happened was, one of our professors, my sophomore year, got fired for SA. 
SPEAKER2 5:46:25
So... 
SPEAKER1 5:46:26
When you say SA... 
SPEAKER3 5:46:28
Sexual assault. 
SPEAKER1 5:46:29
I know that, but, like, what was the situation? Coercion? 
SPEAKER3 5:46:38
I think? I think? 
SPEAKER1 5:46:41
Did he do be doing the diddling? 
SPEAKER3 5:46:43
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER5 5:46:43
He was doing the diddling. 
SPEAKER1 5:46:45
So it was like, oh, do me special favors and I'll give you... 
SPEAKER7 5:46:50
A good grade. 
SPEAKER1 5:46:51
I mean... 
SPEAKER5 5:46:51
I think? 
SPEAKER1 5:46:52
That's pretty common. I feel like it's not ideal, but, like... Fuck, it is. Like, flat out. Flat out. 
SPEAKER7 5:47:04
Oh, hello. 
SPEAKER1 5:47:10
You want me to help you fix your Minecraft, I tell you, while you're still alive? Um... What are you doing, like, tomorrow? I really need to go to bed. I'm tired. Yeah, yeah. 
SPEAKER7 5:47:18
I mean, you can get work with me. I'm still fun. The old job, honestly. 
SPEAKER1 5:47:20
Fuck it. 
SPEAKER3 5:47:23
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 5:47:23
Thanks for staying late, by the way, guys. 
SPEAKER3 5:47:25
I know it was... 
SPEAKER7 5:47:26
A long-ass session. 
SPEAKER1 5:47:28
Nope. No, I appreciate you letting me still play. 
SPEAKER5 5:47:32
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 5:47:32
Oh. 
SPEAKER7 5:47:32
Oh. What I need from you, though, Kevin, is to give me time to assemble people's fucking items and put shit back where it's supposed to be. 
SPEAKER3 5:47:44
Yeah, I will leave... 
SPEAKER7 5:47:47
I won't be doing that tonight. 
SPEAKER5 5:47:48
Well, can you make items right now with the roles you have? Because you have Trusted Player as a role. 
SPEAKER7 5:47:53
Trusted Player cannot make items. Let me double check. Yeah, I can't make items. No. 
SPEAKER1 5:48:00
No, that's an assistant... 
SPEAKER7 5:48:01
I can give them, but I just can't do it. 
SPEAKER3 5:48:02
Okay, it's an assistant GM thing that you need? 
SPEAKER7 5:48:05
Yeah. So, I just need to import all of our items properly and change over the list and fix a few of the broken things apparently I had missed. I was working with only 40 minutes and Tameh is just sitting here watching me sweat in 100 degree weather. 
SPEAKER3 5:48:23
Yeah, I forget. Y'all are... It's... It's, uh... Listen, it's hot up here, but, like... I have an air conditioning system that puts in the work. 
SPEAKER1 5:48:32
I know. The one shitty thing about my new place in Spokane that I haven't moved yet, living in a couple weeks, is that it's... There's no AC and it's universal heating. 
SPEAKER5 5:48:47
Are you gonna be able to survive? 
SPEAKER1 5:48:51
I'm gonna have to. It's in Spokane, so I sacrificed a little bit of my sanity for it. For a cheaper... We're not having to pay gas. Because right now I'm commuting 30 minutes for my internship and 24 class. And I'm basically going to Spokane every day. 
SPEAKER7 5:49:25
And I have to, like, go to my tank every week. 
SPEAKER3 5:49:28
Yeah, that gas money be, uh... 
SPEAKER1 5:49:30
Spancy. Is it just me? It's Spokanean. 
SPEAKER7 5:49:33
And, um... 
SPEAKER1 5:49:35
Don't have to spend this much gas money. Now, I'll be living five minutes from school and ten minutes from my internship. Hmm. Nice. I think I'm just gonna take the bus, too. Which, uh... No gas at all. 
SPEAKER3 5:49:49
Exactly. 
SPEAKER1 5:49:52
Um... 
SPEAKER5 5:49:53
What? How much is gas at where you guys are right now? 
SPEAKER1 5:49:55
Uh-huh. 
SPEAKER3 5:49:57
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 5:49:58
Three-seventy. Something for the cheapest. 
SPEAKER7 5:50:02
I think Ellensburg might be a little bit more than that. 
SPEAKER1 5:50:07
It is. Because I was gonna stop and get gas there. And it was expensive as fuck. So I got my gas in Moses Lake. 
SPEAKER3 5:50:15
Okay. Because the gas out here is 360-something. So we're catching up. 
SPEAKER7 5:50:22
Yeah, Ellensburg doesn't understand the concept of real values of items. 
SPEAKER1 5:50:27
Book house? It went, like, up, up to, like... Three... Ninety-something at one point. Um... At the beginning of summer. And then once school went out, like, it went back down, like... 
SPEAKER3 5:50:44
To three... 
SPEAKER2 5:50:47
Sixty. 
SPEAKER1 5:50:48
And then it went back up to three-seventy. 
SPEAKER3 5:50:50
Okay. Yeah, no. Illinois has a ridiculously high gas tax. And then Missouri... Missouri, it's, like... 320. 330. And I'm like... Fuck these people. 
SPEAKER1 5:51:05
That's how much it is in Idaho. And I live, like, 40 minutes from Idaho. I'll live, like, 20 minutes... 25 minutes from Idaho. 
SPEAKER3 5:51:15
I thought they said when they were gonna legalize weed... That, like, you know, it would bring in tax money and we wouldn't have to pay for shit. 
SPEAKER1 5:51:23
Oh, it does bring in tax money. It's just not going towards the stuff we want it to go. 
SPEAKER5 5:51:28
What is it going towards? 
SPEAKER1 5:51:30
Uh, the fucking... Political figures. 
SPEAKER7 5:51:34
The tax. 
SPEAKER5 5:51:36
I don't care what Congress makes. 
SPEAKER3 5:51:38
I want to be able to eat food. 
SPEAKER5 5:51:41
I want to buy eggs. And not have to sell my child for them. 
SPEAKER1 5:51:44
I mean, they'll get the beef and stuff like this. 
SPEAKER3 5:51:47
They're gonna marry him. 
SPEAKER7 5:51:49
That's another shit. 
SPEAKER5 5:51:51
I signed an oath that said all threats foreign and domestic. And these politicians might be a domestic threat. 
SPEAKER1 5:52:00
Oh, shit. You're right. Blue pole. 
SPEAKER6 5:52:02
Blue pole. 
SPEAKER3 5:52:04
Nah, that's military coup talk. And apparently that is a thing that the U.S. is not supposed to support. 
SPEAKER1 5:52:11
I know. Did you see that opening for the Olympics with the Marian Internet thing? 
SPEAKER5 5:52:18
No, I haven't seen a lot about the Olympics. 
SPEAKER1 5:52:21
I've seen... 
SPEAKER3 5:52:21
Oh, my God. 
SPEAKER5 5:52:22
I've seen the Dionysus Festival and everyone was, like, fucking... 
SPEAKER1 5:52:25
Oh, yeah, I know. 
SPEAKER5 5:52:26
...railing against that. 
SPEAKER3 5:52:27
And I'm like, guys, that's not the Last Supper. That's... 
SPEAKER1 5:52:30
That's a Greek festival. 
SPEAKER5 5:52:32
Greek festival. That's what they're known for. 
SPEAKER3 5:52:34
They're known for a lot of fucking. That's like... It's like kind of the whole thing that God does is, you know, crazy festivals and debauchery. It's kind of the name of the game. 
SPEAKER7 5:52:49
I don't think that makes it any better, though. 
SPEAKER5 5:52:52
I mean... 
SPEAKER7 5:52:52
It's not what you want to do for the fucking... 
SPEAKER5 5:52:58
I'll take that over... 
SPEAKER6 5:53:00
Listen. 
SPEAKER3 5:53:02
Listen. As far as fucky-wucky Olympics, I will still take that over most of the Olympics that have happened in Germany. 
SPEAKER7 5:53:09
I think a lot of the Olympics have been fucking stupid. 
SPEAKER3 5:53:12
Like, the Olympics have never... 
SPEAKER5 5:53:14
There has never been a non-controversial Olympics. 
SPEAKER3 5:53:18
There has never been. 
SPEAKER1 5:53:20
No. Because everybody complains about something. 
SPEAKER7 5:53:22
It's either fucking the eggnest or something to do with fucking that dude using a bow. 
SPEAKER2 5:53:28
It's just all something. 
SPEAKER3 5:53:29
Or it's, you know, human testing. Hitler. 
SPEAKER7 5:53:33
Oh, yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:53:34
The extreme poverty of the workers that had to build the stadium. 
SPEAKER7 5:53:40
I mean, yeah. 
SPEAKER3 5:53:41
Not a single sport having effort. 
SPEAKER5 5:53:44
Like, not a single of the councils. 
SPEAKER3 5:53:46
The sports, you know... 
SPEAKER5 5:53:47
Athletes do what athletes do. 
SPEAKER3 5:53:49
Oh, the anti-sex beds. 
SPEAKER7 5:53:52
Yeah, I'm not a fan of the cardboard bed bullshit. I think that's really fucked. 
SPEAKER5 5:53:56
It's like, listen, y'all are all at the peak and pinnacle of your form. 
SPEAKER3 5:54:02
I don't care who you fuck now. 
SPEAKER5 5:54:05
Go. 
SPEAKER3 5:54:08
Just compete well. 
SPEAKER5 5:54:11
Don't fuck anyone from North Korea. Other than that, you're good. 
SPEAKER7 5:54:15
France? France's people got to sleep on real beds while everybody else had to sleep on cardboard? 
SPEAKER5 5:54:20
No. 
SPEAKER1 5:54:20
I'm certain of the thing. 
SPEAKER7 5:54:22
They didn't, or no? 
SPEAKER3 5:54:23
Nope, they did not. 
SPEAKER5 5:54:25
So, everyone who competes... 
SPEAKER3 5:54:26
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 5:54:27
Everyone who competes has to stay at the Olympic Village. 
SPEAKER3 5:54:31
Um... 
SPEAKER1 5:54:31
That's not true. They don't have to. I remember there was a country that, like, literally paid to be, like, on a cruise ship. And they got, like, all this luxury shit. 
SPEAKER5 5:54:41
That is not a country that has a sport. 
SPEAKER3 5:54:43
Surfing is on a cruise ship. 
SPEAKER5 5:54:49
You're verifying if I'm wrong. 
SPEAKER3 5:54:51
There is a possibility I could be wrong. That is always a thing I can be. 
SPEAKER1 5:54:58
I'm too lazy to do this. 
SPEAKER7 5:55:00
That's what I'm thinking. They did that shit just to fuck everybody over. 
SPEAKER1 5:55:04
But they got a free iPhone out of it. 
SPEAKER3 5:55:07
At the same point, though, like, have you... Has anyone looked at the American athletes? These people are fucking giants. 
SPEAKER7 5:55:17
Yeah, but they didn't do shit. 
SPEAKER1 5:55:21
No, they've done some stuff. 
SPEAKER5 5:55:23
Or the shot putt guy? The guy who's competing on our team for shot putt is competing with himself. 
SPEAKER3 5:55:29
He set the last three for world records. Damn. 
SPEAKER1 5:55:32
Really? 
SPEAKER3 5:55:33
Yes. 
SPEAKER5 5:55:34
And the commentators even admit it. It's like, he's, uh, he's competing with himself. 
SPEAKER3 5:55:38
He's... That is the only person who can beat him. Him. 
SPEAKER1 5:55:41
Okay, I have it on the Mary Antoinette video. 
SPEAKER2 5:55:46
I just have to... 
SPEAKER1 5:55:47
I... You have to see this. Because it was kind of... It was kind of hard. Oh, the fucking intro where it's like the Mary Antoinettes and it's like the famous rowers and it's so badass. Yeah, it's good. Go around them. Which one? I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 5:56:01
It's the next one. 
SPEAKER1 5:56:02
It's the next one. Oh, my God. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It was good. It was a good intro. It was a good intro. And I learned that that song she's singing, that's the song that the fucking peasant sang when they were beheading her, like when they were doing that whole revolution. 
SPEAKER7 5:56:12
That's pretty badass. 
SPEAKER1 5:56:13
I like that. I also haven't kept up, like, too much with all the drama, but so much of it has been 
SPEAKER7 5:56:19
kind of leaking out. 
SPEAKER1 5:56:20
But, like, I love like the fucking guy from, like, Turkey. Yes. The Korean girl who shot and, like, looked badass, and then the guy from Turkey. And I love the, like, the guy from Turkey. And I love the guy from Turkey. who shot and looked badass. And then the guy from Turkey 
SPEAKER3 5:56:31
who rolls up t-shirt and jeans and says I got this. 
SPEAKER1 5:56:36
And like most of the gear too. Looks like a fucking widow maker with his back arch 
SPEAKER5 5:56:40
to the skin. 
SPEAKER1 5:56:41
Oh yeah. 
SPEAKER5 5:56:42
Or the fencing guy who started bunny hopping. 
SPEAKER1 5:56:48
Oh I didn't see that. 
SPEAKER5 5:56:49
Yeah there was a clip where someone was fencing and they just started like you can see on the back foot so they just start bunny hopping. And you can tell the other guy that's fencing 
SPEAKER3 5:56:58
is just so fucking confused. What am I seeing? 
SPEAKER1 5:57:03
So I thought the rules said 
SPEAKER7 5:57:04
that you had to keep your feet on the ground though. 
SPEAKER3 5:57:07
I mean 
SPEAKER7 5:57:08
I don't know shit about fencing at all. 
SPEAKER3 5:57:12
Or the other controversy 
SPEAKER5 5:57:14
with the Chinese endurance skaters 
SPEAKER3 5:57:16
they pulled a strat 
SPEAKER5 5:57:18
where they had one guy 
SPEAKER3 5:57:20
speedrun a lap and then did 
SPEAKER5 5:57:22
the entire rest of the race 
SPEAKER3 5:57:24
as normal. 
SPEAKER5 5:57:25
But because one of them sped run a lap 
SPEAKER3 5:57:27
it meant that that guy was ahead of the entire rest of the competing field. Which is like I mean I guess that is not against the rules but that's just such a departure from the rest of the strategy that it feels like it should be against the rules. 
SPEAKER7 5:57:50
I mean 
SPEAKER2 5:57:51
the innovation 
SPEAKER7 5:57:54
doesn't say that. You can't try something different. 
SPEAKER6 5:57:57
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 5:57:59
I think we just got so used to people doing it a certain way that we got locked into this is the way we have to do it. It's kind of not. 
SPEAKER1 5:58:07
I mean go back a few years 
SPEAKER7 5:58:09
when the American ice skating team ended up doing a completely different lap speed on that. Because they kind of grouped together and people were like how the fuck do you shave off .3 seconds of your shit. That's a lot of time. 
SPEAKER3 5:58:23
Yeah in Olympic metrics that's 
SPEAKER6 5:58:25
a lot of time. 
SPEAKER3 5:58:25
That's a lot of time. 
SPEAKER7 5:58:29
Yeah because they just grabbed each other's ass cheeks and just slid and slung shot each other. 
SPEAKER5 5:58:34
Yeah. 
SPEAKER7 5:58:36
Not being any smart. That's what they gotta do. 
SPEAKER3 5:58:41
Or the snowboarder one year who was like 23 
SPEAKER5 5:58:45
was running late 
SPEAKER3 5:58:46
ended up cursing on live TV and like oh you're so unprofessional 
SPEAKER5 5:58:51
you can't win and they're like but I did. 
SPEAKER7 5:58:55
But I did. Anyways I'm gonna probably log. 
SPEAKER1 5:59:01
I'm gonna fucking medal bitch. 
SPEAKER7 5:59:04
I don't know if you guys will be on tomorrow or whatever you're doing but 
SPEAKER3 5:59:07
probably play some games maybe. I don't know. I should be on. I do want to play some games. I want to actually play some games with people. 
SPEAKER5 5:59:14
I was supposed to be home all weekend this weekend 
SPEAKER3 5:59:16
to play games with y'all. This is supposed to be a gremlin weekend. 
SPEAKER1 5:59:20
We planned on that. 
SPEAKER5 5:59:22
But let me tell you what happened. 
SPEAKER3 5:59:23
Let me tell you. This is about the wild weekend I've had. 
SPEAKER7 5:59:29
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER5 5:59:31
I'll tell you about it later. 
SPEAKER3 5:59:32
Caitlin. 
SPEAKER1 5:59:33
You'll hear about it. 
SPEAKER3 5:59:35
So Friday night I'm playing and none of y'all were online and I was sad. And my coworkers call up and they're like they're like hop on some Fortnite and I'm like okay fine. 
SPEAKER5 5:59:47
BTWs Fortnite. 
SPEAKER6 5:59:49
Huh?
