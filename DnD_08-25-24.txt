SPEAKER6 0:00:00
You won't kill Isanghan, will you? 
SPEAKER3 0:00:06
He tried to kill everybody already. What do you think? 
SPEAKER2 0:00:10
No, that wasn't me trying. 
SPEAKER3 0:00:13
To be fair, it's just a difficult dungeon. We need to approach it 
SPEAKER4 0:00:18
using 
SPEAKER3 0:00:19
a crazy thing called brain cells. 
SPEAKER4 0:00:23
I don't know what those are. I'm sorry. I've lost them. 
SPEAKER2 0:00:28
We know. 
SPEAKER4 0:00:30
I've been stuck with fucking Jojo Pose 
SPEAKER3 0:00:34
and 
SPEAKER6 0:00:35
ETSD Bird. I need to go to the gym 
SPEAKER3 0:00:40
so I can Jojo Pose more. 
SPEAKER5 0:00:43
It's finally real. 
SPEAKER2 0:00:46
It's gonna be real. And, uh... Hey, uh, I'm Garrett. 
SPEAKER3 0:00:59
Why didn't you just boot up a game 
SPEAKER6 0:01:01
when you're about to start a game? Because nothing's happening yet. 
SPEAKER3 0:01:05
Oh my god. 
SPEAKER6 0:01:06
He's gonna sprint to attack us. 
SPEAKER2 0:01:09
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 0:01:10
Hunter, can you tell me 
SPEAKER2 0:01:12
what happened the last time and what you're trying to do? 
SPEAKER3 0:01:18
I enjoyed myself. 
SPEAKER4 0:01:19
That's what happened. 
SPEAKER6 0:01:20
You do know. 
SPEAKER2 0:01:23
What happened last time? The entirety of last session. 
SPEAKER4 0:01:29
Last session? 
SPEAKER6 0:01:30
Yeah, we died. 
SPEAKER4 0:01:32
J'Noon died. 
SPEAKER6 0:01:33
J'Noon came back to life and we left. 
SPEAKER4 0:01:40
Michi died. J'Zer died. 
SPEAKER6 0:01:41
We also got resurrected by the all-time gods. 
SPEAKER3 0:01:43
And now we're fucking 
SPEAKER6 0:01:45
minions to the evil. 
SPEAKER4 0:01:49
Did you guys get us enslaved to another evil faction? 
SPEAKER3 0:01:54
Yeah, definitely. 
SPEAKER6 0:01:55
Yes, but the good gods. 
SPEAKER4 0:01:56
The old gods. 
SPEAKER6 0:02:00
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:00
I believe for one second. Let me think. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:04
Actually, what did happen? Let me think. Because I believe 
SPEAKER4 0:02:07
like we escaped. We got J'Noon. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:10
Isang Han shoved J'Noon in a bag. We resurrected J'Noon and then went with the flumps 
SPEAKER6 0:02:15
back to kind of a safe space and then we just left the cave. Basically. Essentially, we have a wheelchair cripple with us now. I made J'Noon the most fancy helmet fashioned. I made J'Noon the most fancy helmet fashioned. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:30
out of a only slightly rotten human skull. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:34
Slightly used, rotten human skull. 
SPEAKER1 0:02:40
Yep. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:40
Only slightly used. 
SPEAKER6 0:02:47
Koi slaps him on top. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:49
Well here, look. 
SPEAKER4 0:02:50
It's a medium used skull. 
SPEAKER6 0:02:52
It can be yours for a cheap, low, low price of something. I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:57
It has a chip. 
SPEAKER2 0:02:58
It's an arm and a leg. 
SPEAKER1 0:02:59
Wait. 
SPEAKER3 0:02:59
Maybe a book? 
SPEAKER6 0:03:00
Wait. 
SPEAKER3 0:03:01
Can we give it? David, what would its armor class be? 
SPEAKER6 0:03:04
Could this like actually be a piece of armor 
SPEAKER3 0:03:06
that J'Noon keeps? Because it was like well crafted. 
SPEAKER6 0:03:12
So that means it's a viable, 
SPEAKER3 0:03:14
like genuinely good. 
SPEAKER6 0:03:16
That's not what that means. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:18
That means you made a human skull. You made a bone. 
SPEAKER3 0:03:21
Human bone. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:22
Which is not great armor. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:23
Which is not great armor. 
SPEAKER6 0:03:24
I think you're gonna. 
SPEAKER1 0:03:25
I think you're gonna. 
SPEAKER2 0:03:26
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:27
I was gonna say, 
SPEAKER6 0:03:28
I think you made cloth, 
SPEAKER4 0:03:29
or clothing. 
SPEAKER3 0:03:30
You can hand it to Michi 
SPEAKER6 0:03:31
and she could try. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:32
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 0:03:33
I made clothing. 
SPEAKER3 0:03:34
And it looks really fashionable. 
SPEAKER4 0:03:38
I'm so cat and mat. It's so good to be back on the surface. 
SPEAKER6 0:03:44
Alright, I gotta open up that crap. Is anybody missing anything? I think Hunter's gloves should be there now? 
SPEAKER4 0:03:58
Let me know if you can see those, Hunter. 
SPEAKER6 0:04:08
Good talk, good talk. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:11
Hey Hunter, 
SPEAKER2 0:04:12
what would you say if I just killed J'zzr and you had to start over this session? 
SPEAKER4 0:04:17
What? 
SPEAKER6 0:04:18
Alright, I know what I'm doing. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:22
I wanna see J'zzr's redemption though. I do think it could be a really interesting character. Exactly. I've gotten a little bit invested in it, to be honest. 
SPEAKER4 0:04:32
I'm invested. I'm invested to see our dysfunctional little family function some more, less. 
SPEAKER3 0:04:45
Functional. Functional. Oh yes, Koi, we are very dysfunctional. 
SPEAKER1 0:04:52
Functional. Functional. Functional. Functional. Functional. Functional. One sec, I'ma get myself a new racehorse. Fun exceptional. 
SPEAKER3 0:05:01
Fun exceptional. One sec, I'ma need just a bit more space, I'm gonna take a bad look, 
SPEAKER4 0:05:04
so I can just spawn these guys. Two sec. 
SPEAKER3 0:05:06
Two sec. Two sec. 
SPEAKER6 0:05:08
Bonus changing, 
SPEAKER4 0:05:09
plus the 
SPEAKER3 0:05:23
Ouch. 
SPEAKER6 0:05:24
Among us, 
SPEAKER3 0:05:25
there is still a bunch of people. thank you for. I did come in here swinging, accusing Devin 
SPEAKER6 0:05:29
of lactose intolerance hard and... Lacticide. 
SPEAKER4 0:05:34
That's... Filthy. 
SPEAKER3 0:05:36
Lacticide. That's like such a regular occurrence 
SPEAKER6 0:05:39
that actually that could be kind of dysfunctional. But it's fun. 
SPEAKER4 0:05:44
Well, it's his fucking fault 
SPEAKER6 0:05:45
for trying to kill himself with lactose. 
SPEAKER3 0:05:47
He stopped at the alcohol so he didn't get in trouble. Now he's just doing it with milk. 
SPEAKER4 0:05:51
His inventory does not contain gloves. 
SPEAKER3 0:05:58
Uh, hold on. Jizzer doesn't? 
SPEAKER6 0:06:02
No, there's no way. I gave it to him last... the other night. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:08
Inventory. 
SPEAKER4 0:06:11
How? 
SPEAKER6 0:06:12
He can't do it. You never give him ownership of the gloves. 
SPEAKER4 0:06:19
So I'll do it. Here. 
SPEAKER6 0:06:21
Uh, there you go. 
SPEAKER4 0:06:25
There. He has it anyway. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:27
Probably doesn't know how to do it 
SPEAKER6 0:06:28
because not a lot of people do. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:32
They are in your inventory now. Oh. 
SPEAKER6 0:06:34
In like the weird little briefcase tab. Yes. The, uh... Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:06:42
And you spent an hour attuning to those. 
SPEAKER6 0:06:45
Must identify this item. Yeah. And you have identified the item because you attuned to it. 
SPEAKER4 0:06:51
And did you equip it? Uh, I'm trying to... Uh... Nope. I imported the thing. 
SPEAKER3 0:07:11
Uh, oh, you gave him the stirring dragon touch focus, 
SPEAKER6 0:07:14
the old ones. 
SPEAKER4 0:07:16
Uh, do you see one down at the bottom of your list? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, you can go ahead. 
SPEAKER3 0:07:25
Let me... 
SPEAKER6 0:07:27
View item artwork. Yeah. I don't think you got the new one. It's been updated since then. You used to be the one with like a picture on it though, right? 
SPEAKER3 0:07:38
Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:07:40
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 0:07:40
And then I tried dragging it to my inventory and it said import via plutonium. 
SPEAKER4 0:07:43
So I did. Didn't need to do that. I love this, uh, white text on white background. 
SPEAKER3 0:07:54
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 0:07:54
That's why I changed that shit. 
SPEAKER3 0:07:56
More than one suit of armor equipped. 
SPEAKER1 0:07:58
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 0:08:00
Whatevs. How do I... Oh, you can do like a little drop down menu. That's cool. Yeah, you can delete the one without the image if you want to, and then keep the one with the image. 
SPEAKER4 0:08:13
I think the text and the attributes should be working on that one. 
SPEAKER6 0:08:19
I can't remember. 
SPEAKER3 0:08:20
Items... 
SPEAKER4 0:08:21
Old. Spells old. It's just under macros and items. Then I dragged it over to my inventory and it like did a thing and now it's untextured. 
SPEAKER6 0:08:35
It just has the description. Joey, keep down. 
SPEAKER4 0:08:38
It's under macros and what? Sorry, I didn't hear that. Macros and items. Oh, it's in macros and items. Uh, for jizzard? Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 0:08:51
Oh, that's cool. 
SPEAKER2 0:08:52
I'll just take a guess. 
SPEAKER4 0:08:53
It shouldn't be there. I can see the playlists. Bone. No, what's in the list? So open up your character sheet, go to your inventory, and you said you see the one with the image, right? 
SPEAKER1 0:09:09
Oh shit. 
SPEAKER6 0:09:11
Oh, oh, okay. Is thismy in the Compendium pack? Is that where I'm supposed to look for it? No, yeah, it's on your character sheet. 
SPEAKER4 0:09:18
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER1 0:09:19
So... 
SPEAKER4 0:09:20
Okay, so under the little briefcase icon, it says decks, macros, and items for Gizzard. No, no. Just go to your character sheet. 
SPEAKER1 0:09:30
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:09:33
Looking at it. Oh, something changed. Yep, in your inventory. Then you'll see a string, Dragon Touch focused. Yeah. Not anymore. It's gone. There should be one down there with a little blue glove. Maybe I just need to reload the page? 
SPEAKER6 0:09:51
Yeah, maybe. 
SPEAKER4 0:10:06
Second. Oh, I definitely pinged it in the chat a couple times. Or not pinged, but shared it. 
SPEAKER6 0:10:13
Yeah, that was me. Sorry. 
SPEAKER4 0:10:16
I thought I'd... 
SPEAKER3 0:10:17
Oh, okay. String, Dragon Touch focused. It has a little picture this time. 
SPEAKER6 0:10:21
Yeah, a little blue glove. It's a trinket. 
SPEAKER3 0:10:24
Yep. 
SPEAKER6 0:10:25
I thought it was supposed to... Alright. I can change that. Hold on, let me actually double check. Because that's the way it comes on the other one, is it's a default trinket. Yeah. Fuck, I keep clicking the button. 
SPEAKER4 0:10:39
So I guess I attuned to this. 
SPEAKER6 0:10:43
Yeah, I believe focuses are classified as a trinket. 
SPEAKER2 0:10:47
Hmm. Not really, they're classified as spellcasting focus. 
SPEAKER3 0:10:51
Well, if you go to details and try to go equipment type, do you see anything that says focus here? 
SPEAKER4 0:10:57
I guess like a necklace would be a trinket. 
SPEAKER2 0:11:01
I'm not saying that based on how the software is, I'm saying that how... As to how actual indie ruling goes. It's not actually a trinket, it's a spellcasting focus. 
SPEAKER1 0:11:10
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. squared. Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:11:19
All right, I'm not going to go with that unless you want me to. 
SPEAKER6 0:11:20
All right. 
SPEAKER4 0:11:21
Don't. 
SPEAKER1 0:11:22
Happy to play as that mini boss, uh, man. 
SPEAKER4 0:11:23
Hey! 
SPEAKER3 0:11:24
I don't know that you ever were Ryan Davis or something, and I'm not going to call it 
SPEAKER4 0:11:25
Ryan Davis. 
SPEAKER6 0:11:26
This is whirring funny for some reason I should say. If our game. 
SPEAKER1 0:11:28
Was definitely, uh, gosh, I can't, I'm going to say vernacular because I've probably 
SPEAKER4 0:11:29
been like, have you? 
SPEAKER3 0:11:30
It'sø 
SPEAKER6 0:11:31
LEd, man I can't, I can't, gotta call him, I'm not gonna say nicknames. 
SPEAKER1 0:11:32
He's not. Also I don't think it was anything like Nicky. I don't think it was anything like Thoughwad, of course. 
SPEAKER4 0:11:36
Oh my god. 
SPEAKER6 0:11:38
Jesus Christ, we can see that though. 
SPEAKER5 0:11:41
What? How? 
SPEAKER4 0:11:42
It's a self-roll. I have GM. 
SPEAKER3 0:11:46
Total. 
SPEAKER4 0:11:49
Oh, it's not going to do the dimensions. Sad. 
SPEAKER6 0:12:04
Thank god. It has a limitation. 
SPEAKER3 0:12:06
Haha. 
SPEAKER6 0:12:12
One. 
SPEAKER4 0:12:15
Hold on, let's see, I'm kind of curious now. 
SPEAKER6 0:12:24
Oh, that's a shitty drink. 
SPEAKER3 0:12:28
Hmm? 
SPEAKER5 0:12:31
Oh, this could be an excuse for me to day drink too. 
SPEAKER4 0:12:34
I might do. I'm just like, why not? 
SPEAKER3 0:12:39
Yeah, I mean, why not? I've been having wine lately. I'm gonna become one of those Facebook moms who's like, I'm not an alcoholic, I'm just quirky. I was gonna say, you have now four cats. 
SPEAKER6 0:12:51
Yeah, of course you're gonna drink them today. 
SPEAKER3 0:12:53
No, it's three cats. Oh, but I could get another one. 
SPEAKER6 0:12:59
I think Jimmy needs lots of friends. 
SPEAKER4 0:13:03
I'd get a cat for my cat. 
SPEAKER1 0:13:06
I'm gonna get a cat for my cat. I'm gonna get a cat for my cat. I'm gonna get a cat for my cat. 
SPEAKER4 0:13:12
Your cat needs a cat. 
SPEAKER6 0:13:14
Actually, speaking of cats for my cat, Gemini and Loki, because Loki's kind of the younger one that Manny and Sarah have, I think they're kind of starting to play, and it's really cute. And also I'm happy for Gem that she gets a cat to like, that she can like play with and, you know, stimulate her little brain with play. 
SPEAKER4 0:13:35
Oh, that's great. 
SPEAKER3 0:13:37
That's cool. 
SPEAKER4 0:13:38
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:13:40
They're still kind of figuring out how to play, because I don't think either of them have really played with a cat before. So they kinda like, Gemini will kinda like, run up, but like in a really goofy looking way to Loki. And then Loki just looks offended, and then Gem looks offended, and then walks away, and then Loki will do the same thing to Gem, and they just keep doing that! 
SPEAKER4 0:14:05
It's really cute. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:07
They do that little sideways archback fluff up. Kind of. Like, not too fluffy, but they kind of start to and then, like, walk away. That's cute. Get a video. 
SPEAKER6 0:14:19
I'll try. I'll try. It's... 
SPEAKER3 0:14:22
I'll have to catch it. 
SPEAKER6 0:14:26
Bells is just an old lady. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:29
She's really dramatic, so sometimes she'll just, like, scream at Gemini like Gemini's just walking by. 
SPEAKER4 0:14:33
And she starts 
SPEAKER6 0:14:35
meowing. Like, dude, chill. Just playing in her own way. Old. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:44
Lazy. It's more like a little slightly territorial, but Bells is very dramatic. She's also a 
SPEAKER6 0:14:51
gigantic puffball, and I love it. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:55
Hmm. 
SPEAKER6 0:14:57
Alright. 
SPEAKER3 0:14:57
I've got some tequila 
SPEAKER4 0:14:59
for a small shot, and 
SPEAKER3 0:15:02
that'll be after my wine, so if I get sick and die, who cares? Still waiting on... 
SPEAKER6 0:15:08
Aliana. 
SPEAKER3 0:15:11
Aliana said that she had stuff to move, and that she wanted to get that done today. 
SPEAKER4 0:15:15
Let me... 
SPEAKER3 0:15:18
see. 
SPEAKER6 0:15:20
She said, 
SPEAKER3 0:15:21
I don't know when I'll have my PC set up, having internet issues at the new place, 
SPEAKER4 0:15:26
and 
SPEAKER3 0:15:27
wanting to get the old place 
SPEAKER6 0:15:29
cleaned if possible. 
SPEAKER4 0:15:33
She has said nothing more, 
SPEAKER6 0:15:36
so we are unsure. 
SPEAKER3 0:15:40
Natalia, how are you? 
SPEAKER4 0:15:45
Oh. 
SPEAKER6 0:15:46
What? Well, yeah, you're a spa. That was really funny timing, actually. Okay. Alright, what do I need to make these potions? I need glowstone. 
SPEAKER4 0:16:14
She's gonna try to restart her internet, 
SPEAKER6 0:16:16
she said. She thinks her dad is blocking the firewalls. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:22
Through the firewalls. The firewalls. Where did she say this? 
SPEAKER6 0:16:28
Uh, private message. Oh. 
SPEAKER1 0:16:33

SPEAKER2 0:17:18
And Jojo pose with. You're in Seattle. 
SPEAKER6 0:17:22
Figure it out. Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:17:26
Gross little Seattle people. 
SPEAKER3 0:17:28
There's a fitness center right here. I'm sure I could convince Manny and Sierra and Brandon is like the third person 
SPEAKER6 0:17:35
who's also our roommate and friend with them. I could convince all three of them to work out probably. No way I don't have any glowstone. 
SPEAKER4 0:18:02
Why? 
SPEAKER6 0:18:02
Why is that not translating there? Oh, speaking of exercise, 
SPEAKER4 0:18:12
there's... 
SPEAKER3 0:18:13
I'll just Google this. I'm sure I can find a lot if I just Google it. 
SPEAKER4 0:18:18
But, you guys, 
SPEAKER3 0:18:21
would you know any body weight 
SPEAKER4 0:18:23
exercises 
SPEAKER3 0:18:25
or just weight exercises 
SPEAKER4 0:18:27
that really... 
SPEAKER5 0:18:29
I just love using machines, 
SPEAKER3 0:18:30
but I'm a little unsure. Like sometimes how to do the exact same thing with 
SPEAKER4 0:18:34
not just weight, 
SPEAKER3 0:18:36
but like body weight type exercises. I like the feeling of like the machine where it's like a very slow measured, um, 
SPEAKER6 0:18:45
like, 
SPEAKER4 0:18:45
ah, 
SPEAKER3 0:18:47
trying to think like, 
SPEAKER6 0:18:48
like the execution of the movement is very satisfying 
SPEAKER3 0:18:51
because it's very like measured. 
SPEAKER6 0:18:52
Um, is there like, 
SPEAKER3 0:18:55
so like I want to know if there's, I want to try to find like body weight exercises 
SPEAKER6 0:18:59
that do like a similar work. 
SPEAKER3 0:19:01
Similar groups and also have a similar, 
SPEAKER4 0:19:03
I don't know, 
SPEAKER3 0:19:04
like vibe? 
SPEAKER6 0:19:05
Sensation? 
SPEAKER3 0:19:06
Whatever the fuck. 
SPEAKER6 0:19:09
Execution? I don't know. I don't know how to phrase it. 
SPEAKER2 0:19:15
You want to find a body weight exercise where it's more controlled because you're trying to get what a machine would do? 
SPEAKER3 0:19:22
Kind of. 
SPEAKER6 0:19:23
Well, I saw your choice that control comes from yourself. 
SPEAKER2 0:19:26
That's the point of body weight exercise. 
SPEAKER3 0:19:28
Yeah. No, it's just, I'm trying to think like, 
SPEAKER4 0:19:31
fuck, 
SPEAKER3 0:19:32
I don't know how to work phrase it. Nevermind. 
SPEAKER6 0:19:34
I'll just find a few body weight exercises that I, 
SPEAKER3 0:19:37
I'll just experiment with them and see which ones I like. I realized how dumb that question was as I asked. 
SPEAKER4 0:19:47
Not dumb. 
SPEAKER6 0:19:48
It's a good question. 
SPEAKER3 0:19:52
Stop not letting me self deprecate. 
SPEAKER5 0:19:55
How dare you? 
SPEAKER4 0:20:01
There are no dumb questions when it comes to exercise. You just ask the question. It's better to ask questions and get hurt. It's what the old motto is. 
SPEAKER6 0:20:15
Oh, yeah. Because you'll have people like, yeah, I can fucking do 200, and then they do a squat, they shit their whole intestines out, and they're like, 
SPEAKER3 0:20:26
oh, well, congratulations, you now know you can't do that. 
SPEAKER6 0:20:29
Oh, God. 
SPEAKER3 0:20:30
I hate, 
SPEAKER6 0:20:31
the fucking machine, 
SPEAKER3 0:20:33
the videos of people doing the squat machine and going too hard, 
SPEAKER6 0:20:36
like, just kill me inside. I can't, can't stand those. 
SPEAKER3 0:20:42
Hello? Hello? 
SPEAKER5 0:20:44
Is this better? 
SPEAKER6 0:20:45
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 0:20:45
I can hear you. Hello. 
SPEAKER1 0:20:48
This is fantastic. 
SPEAKER4 0:20:52

Beautiful. I do know Irene, 
SPEAKER4 0:22:30
all of the so we're like we're like two hours south of denver so whenever we take off we have to get on the radio tuned to like the the sort of the air traffic controller that does all the airspace like around denver and we also have to be on like this special channel for our training base where like all we're all talking about what we're doing where we are and then like trying to listen to both of those talking over each other at the same time while the instructor is trying to tell you stuff and you're trying to play it gets pretty and it's like 100 degrees and it gets pretty pretty crazy but it's fun it sounds like fun though 
SPEAKER2 0:23:21
maybe 
SPEAKER6 0:23:27
maybe 
SPEAKER2 0:23:27
yeah 
SPEAKER4 0:23:29

SPEAKER3 0:24:26
i didn't hear your answer therefore it's not valid 
SPEAKER6 0:24:29
You are an alcoholic. 
SPEAKER3 0:24:31
Yeah, I found that 
SPEAKER4 0:24:32
tequila we had when we were out at Gameworks. It is called Vulcan. 
SPEAKER6 0:24:41
Oh, is that what you sent a picture of? Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:24:44
What's it called? 
SPEAKER4 0:24:47
Vulcan. 
SPEAKER3 0:24:51
It is a Blanco. 
SPEAKER4 0:24:52
It is extremely 
SPEAKER3 0:24:55
difficult to find, but it tastes pretty damn good in my opinion. 
SPEAKER2 0:24:59
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 0:25:14
I'm going to need everyone to wait. 
SPEAKER1 0:25:22
Let's see. 
SPEAKER4 0:25:27
I couldn't get a 
SPEAKER6 0:25:28
full glass. The bottle's gone. I'm sad. 
SPEAKER3 0:25:33
We are waiting. 
SPEAKER6 0:25:35
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:25:39
Realistically, there are two issues 
SPEAKER2 0:25:40
we need to talk about first before we start the game again. 
SPEAKER4 0:25:45
First being, 
SPEAKER2 0:25:47
there seems to be a bit of a mismatch 
SPEAKER4 0:25:48
between what everyone 
SPEAKER2 0:25:50
in the game party is looking for as kind of tonality of what game they're looking for. It seems, a lot of people's perspective, 
SPEAKER4 0:26:00
from what I've heard and what I've observed, 
SPEAKER2 0:26:02
that there are, 
SPEAKER4 0:26:04
there's this split. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:06
I think certain players in your groups want to play more of a silly, 
SPEAKER4 0:26:09
laissez faire, 
SPEAKER3 0:26:11
hell or let be type game. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:15
And there are those players who want to have much more of a serious, this is important, playing my character is important, 
SPEAKER3 0:26:21
and more of a nitty gritty character. 
SPEAKER4 0:26:24
Right? 
SPEAKER1 0:26:24
Hm. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:28
I have tried to see if I could potentially marry the two. But with the way things continue to go, and with the situations everyone's finding themselves in, there's not just frustration in the party in the game, but now there's frustration outside of it. And I don't have a good solution 
SPEAKER4 0:26:45
that allows me to do all of it at once. 
SPEAKER3 0:26:49
Campaign that I had originally envisioned 
SPEAKER2 0:26:52
was more serious, 
SPEAKER4 0:26:53
with some silliness thrown in. That is to say, I can't. 
SPEAKER3 0:26:58
Make it. 
SPEAKER2 0:26:59
Especially since large parts of it have had to be re-gripped anyway. 
SPEAKER3 0:27:02
But I can't make this more of a casual, 
SPEAKER2 0:27:05
laissez faire, just a select venture campaign. I don't know what all the players are trying to want from this, 
SPEAKER3 0:27:11
or trying to achieve. 
SPEAKER2 0:27:12
So I'd like to actually start that dialogue 
SPEAKER4 0:27:14
as players. 
SPEAKER2 0:27:16
What is everyone trying to, or wanting this campaign to be, tonality-wise? 
SPEAKER4 0:27:28
I think you should call on someone. 
SPEAKER6 0:27:35
I'll just start. I am fine. 
SPEAKER3 0:27:38
Like, I think I kind of prefer what you were initially heading towards, Devon. 
SPEAKER6 0:27:43
But ultimately, I am content to play either style. I think it might be best if we kind of pick one, 
SPEAKER4 0:27:51
and then let, if we pick serious, 
SPEAKER3 0:27:53
let the funny-ness kind of come naturally. 
SPEAKER4 0:27:57
Probably. 
SPEAKER3 0:27:58
Possibly over time. Or if we pick more funny, let the serious moments kind of start to pepper themselves in. 
SPEAKER6 0:28:05
But I think it might be best if the group kind of picks more one direction. 
SPEAKER1 0:28:09
Hm. 
SPEAKER4 0:28:11
I guess I'll go next. Uh, 
SPEAKER3 0:28:15
I kind of like the serious tone, 
SPEAKER6 0:28:17
but I do like the fact of adapting funny mechanics in. 
SPEAKER4 0:28:21
But when serious times come, they should be as such. And I'm not saying like, they need to be, 
SPEAKER6 0:28:29
oh, this is fucking 40k, 
SPEAKER3 0:28:30
and we need to kill all people 
SPEAKER6 0:28:32
and be super analytical, and you better have all your character sheet, and, no, I'm not into that. 
SPEAKER4 0:28:38
I'm saying like, if it impacts somebody, 
SPEAKER3 0:28:42
or it's going to impact the whole group, 
SPEAKER4 0:28:44
then seriousness is where I kind of want to be on that one. Um, the other times, fun mechanics like your original vision 
SPEAKER6 0:28:52
is kind of where I'm at. 
SPEAKER4 0:28:57
I can't agree with that. I think a little silliness in there is cool. But, yeah, to me, 
SPEAKER2 0:29:05
like, the big draw for this campaign 
SPEAKER4 0:29:07
has been having like a, sort of like a semi, not semi, it's like a serious sort of like kidnapping slash possible murder mystery with like implications for the whole magical system in the world. And I'm, I'm not sure. I'm mostly invested right now in trying to get to the bottom of that and crack the case. 
SPEAKER2 0:29:34
That kind of thing. 
SPEAKER4 0:29:39
So, I didn't hear you at the beginning. What did you say, like originally? Because you're kind of like, get quiet. Oh, sorry. Sorry, let me, let me 
SPEAKER2 0:29:49
check around. 
SPEAKER4 0:29:53
Okay, can you hear better now? Yeah. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 0:29:58
So, I was saying at the start, yeah, what kind of got me invested is 
SPEAKER4 0:30:04
the whole like mystery of who kidnapped the kids 
SPEAKER3 0:30:11
and why and trying to find them. 
SPEAKER4 0:30:13
And then going off of that into, we, you know, we had all the connections with 
SPEAKER3 0:30:18
Professor Blackwood and like magic and all that. 
SPEAKER4 0:30:20
So, sort of leaning into the idea that it could 
SPEAKER3 0:30:24
have like big magical implications for this whole world. This whole area or whatever. 
SPEAKER4 0:30:28
Yeah. So, for me, I think the tone that I've been getting 
SPEAKER3 0:30:32
is like a sort of serious 
SPEAKER4 0:30:34
magical mystery thing with like consequences. And yeah, I, I enjoy that tone. And like Kaylin said, you know, 
SPEAKER3 0:30:45
a little silliness thrown in there is cool. 
SPEAKER4 0:30:47
I like that also. But yeah, more serious is what I'm getting. I feel like I also lean towards the more serious. 
SPEAKER5 0:31:06
It means that we can't have funny moments. Because I feel like there's some things like 
SPEAKER6 0:31:11
in the middle of a rough situation, 
SPEAKER5 0:31:13
you have gallows humor or you just have something 
SPEAKER6 0:31:15
absolutely ridiculous happen. 
SPEAKER4 0:31:17
But I lean more. 
SPEAKER1 0:31:20
I think. I think. I think. I think. 
SPEAKER2 0:31:24
I think. 
SPEAKER4 0:31:25
I think. 
SPEAKER3 0:31:26
I think. 
SPEAKER4 0:31:27
I think. 
SPEAKER1 0:31:28
I think. 
SPEAKER4 0:31:29
I think like when Goofy thinks. Yeah. It's been doing that. 
SPEAKER5 0:31:33
Basically, serious. 
SPEAKER2 0:31:35
Hello. 
SPEAKER4 0:31:42
Hello, Wum. 
SPEAKER6 0:31:43
Hello. 
SPEAKER4 0:31:44
Welcome. 
SPEAKER3 0:31:49
We're a bit late, but essentially the discussion 
SPEAKER2 0:31:52
posed before we actually get into the game itself is into the game itself is trying to actually as a party decide what kind of tonality everyone's 
SPEAKER3 0:32:00
looking for moving forward because there has been a bit of an incongruency in the game of when we're 
SPEAKER2 0:32:07
treating moments as serious moments when we're treating moments as silly comedic moments and what type of things we're doing at the moment out there so i'm trying to have a discussion about 
SPEAKER4 0:32:17
table because i can do either way but i want to know what the people want i'm made of people i personally feel like it's pretty straightforward like the serious like be silly when like when we can be silly but like the serious parts like obviously be serious when when there are serious parts like when we're not trying to fight monsters and there's clearly monsters don't do something stupid that would attract monsters but obviously when we are wanting to fight monsters 
SPEAKER6 0:33:03
and we are fighting monsters jojo pose on that bitch 
SPEAKER4 0:33:07
i agree to that you know yeah like like i think there's a good balance 
SPEAKER2 0:33:14
yeah like 
SPEAKER3 0:33:17
silliness so long it doesn't overrule or overshadow 
SPEAKER4 0:33:21
seriousness or in in impedes and truths upon getting shit done okay until you're the last one last call out here yeah are you paying attention yeah the tonality of the campaign okay i mean yeah i kind of agree 
SPEAKER2 0:33:54
okay i'm gonna be the one to be the asshole in the room and point it out hunter this is mainly based targeted towards you 
SPEAKER4 0:34:01
yeah i know so i we need a little bit more buy-in than just yes okay like what we don't want jizzard to go away 
SPEAKER3 0:34:10
i don't think anyone here wants jizzard to be gone not only are there there been a lot of funny moments you're a great campaign driver you never want to be the asshole in the room 
SPEAKER2 0:34:12
not only are there there been a lot of funny moments you're a great campaign driver you never want to be the asshole in the room 
SPEAKER4 0:34:17
you jump on people have to come back we really don't have the advantage of any of your prior field of attention however every character that has been 
SPEAKER3 0:34:23
attack i think 
SPEAKER4 0:34:24
in this campaign has been burned because of either in character decisions you've made that then don't 
SPEAKER2 0:34:31
make sense or out of character player actions such as not paying attention to anything that LIKE going on in the game personally as a dm i've also been burned because while i don't get to put a lot of prep time into this as much as i want to i've still put a very decent amount of time into trying to write and get things working but i haven't had much prepared me about how i had got this so far since i got over with the frantic vole cause i did not have enough toम 
SPEAKER4 0:34:46
working and sometimes it feels like there is no attention or understanding towards that effort. 
SPEAKER2 0:34:54
For example, Michi is trying to give this this really big moment of hey you want me to 
SPEAKER4 0:35:00
revive your friend or not this is kind of your guys' fault that you're in this situation and even though that was the latest in a long string of attempts to try and actually get Gizzard to be a semi-serious character at all there was nothing. There have been so many times where you're not paying attention. There are other tasks to do other things. I've tried to make this more engaging but we need more bonding. I mean I have been paying attention it's just a lot of the time I don't know what to do. You could ask. Ask what you can and can't do. 
SPEAKER2 0:35:40
This is D&D this is not a video game. There is so much lateral movement and the ridiculousness of what you can and can't do both as a combat mechanic and as role play. So if you ever have something where like hey I don't know what we're going to do instead of 
SPEAKER4 0:35:58
shutting down and silent or disengaging ask. Ask the DM if you can do an action or ask the other players in character if that's a thing that makes sense. The other characters have agents just like 
SPEAKER2 0:36:10
your character does. 
SPEAKER1 0:36:12
So 
SPEAKER2 0:36:23
but 
SPEAKER4 0:36:26
Targeted Man decided sorry I am sorry for calling out. Once again you're a great friend. I love having you in this game. I'm just trying to sort some things out so that no one burns anyone 
SPEAKER2 0:36:41
else's house down. I'm just trying to sort some things out so that no one burns anyone else's house down. I'm just trying to sort some things out so that no one burns anyone else's house down. Because their character died or got bisected. 
SPEAKER4 0:36:45
I don't got a house. I have shelter as Quaid puts it. A house is a type of shelter. 
SPEAKER6 0:36:54
No. No longer have shelter. 
SPEAKER3 0:36:58
I do want to say through in here that going with the serious tone of the game I think it 
SPEAKER4 0:37:04
would be nice if this certain turn around before but I think it'd be nice if we with our characters tried to act more as a party because there have been a lot of things over even like just the time that I've been in here where we've just been like people just like stealing from each other for like no reason and you know putting people in bags and like just seeing like when we went in the cave and like me and jess are going around the corner to fight a thing and then someone like shouted our 
SPEAKER3 0:37:37
name and didn't hear a response and decided that we're just going to move on it's like that's just like that doesn't seem like things as an adventuring party that's like on a serious 
SPEAKER4 0:37:45
endeavor to do stuff together is going to do. 
SPEAKER2 0:37:48
No but at the same point when you don't hear a response and we can't tell if that's because the character in character is refusing to respond or because the player is playing a different game 
SPEAKER4 0:38:00
and is completely not paying attention that then leads to a minute and a half of us all sitting 
SPEAKER2 0:38:05
silent in this corner trying to figure out the way to the cave so it is their character just 
SPEAKER3 0:38:10
in a different dimension. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:11
Like if you're going to if you're going to role play out if you're going to say okay my characters won't respond and let you silence hang in the air as a courtesy to the other players too if you're going to do that and try to role play that way you got to actually be like hey my character is just not going to respond. I like going on that one specific scenario I like I did say that yeah and that was in character thing like yeah. So I guess I agree with what you're saying I just think in the past that's not how 
SPEAKER3 0:38:51
things have been treated I think it would be good if they're treated that way. 
SPEAKER4 0:38:54
Yeah I just want to see like all of us not being dicks to each other as much. 
SPEAKER6 0:39:00
No I agree to that. 
SPEAKER4 0:39:03
And there are situations where being counterproductive might seem like the ultimate goal 
SPEAKER6 0:39:10
but we also need to be able to do it. 
SPEAKER4 0:39:11
I also need to remember there are other goals that a player might have to doing something for somebody. So like an example Michi taking the necklace from Janoon as you kind of pointed out is not 
SPEAKER3 0:39:33
necessarily her stealing something but potentially getting something for that person set up. 
SPEAKER1 0:39:38
I'm not someone to steal. 
SPEAKER2 0:39:39
I'm not someone to steal. 
SPEAKER6 0:39:39
I'm not someone to steal. I'm not someone to steal. 
SPEAKER3 0:39:40
I'm not someone to steal. 
SPEAKER6 0:39:41
I'm not someone to steal. 
SPEAKER4 0:39:41
I'm not someone to steal. Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 0:39:43
When you guys are going to try and maneuver that way because unfortunately via the medium 
SPEAKER4 0:39:49
that we are going that we are going through a lot of the actual like body communication 
SPEAKER2 0:39:55
of the tonality let me let me really quickly slide in what I'm going to do as a funny thing can get lost. So just yeah. 
SPEAKER6 0:40:06
Yeah it comes down to just malicious intent really. 
SPEAKER4 0:40:10
and how do we decipher that 
SPEAKER3 0:40:12
and we as players we kind of need to 
SPEAKER6 0:40:15
talk about it a little bit more 
SPEAKER4 0:40:16
at least in my opinion I'm not a fucking guidance 
SPEAKER3 0:40:20
counselor 
SPEAKER4 0:40:21
but anyways we start in this candle 
SPEAKER2 0:40:29
are we all in agreement 
SPEAKER5 0:40:31
on the 
SPEAKER4 0:40:33
on the event of 
SPEAKER6 0:40:37
at June 
SPEAKER5 0:40:38
leaving the two 
SPEAKER4 0:40:41
in June's head June had been 
SPEAKER6 0:40:49
kind of fed up because 
SPEAKER4 0:40:51
at that point 
SPEAKER6 0:40:53
Desert had 
SPEAKER4 0:40:55
healed up 
SPEAKER3 0:40:57
a roper 
SPEAKER6 0:40:58
who was already nearly 
SPEAKER4 0:41:01
dead and 
SPEAKER5 0:41:03
so I feel 
SPEAKER3 0:41:04
that was justifiable to 
SPEAKER5 0:41:06
kind of be fed up 
SPEAKER2 0:41:07
and 
SPEAKER5 0:41:08
if someone did that to me 
SPEAKER4 0:41:10
in real life 
SPEAKER5 0:41:12
I'd be kind of fed up with someone 
SPEAKER4 0:41:14
making decisions like that and so 
SPEAKER6 0:41:18
I felt that was justifiable in character 
SPEAKER3 0:41:21
I can understand that angle 
SPEAKER4 0:41:23
from your character but also 
SPEAKER3 0:41:26
the board was there too 
SPEAKER4 0:41:27
the board hadn't done anything to you 
SPEAKER3 0:41:29
and also the entire rest of the group 
SPEAKER4 0:41:31
also left with you know 
SPEAKER3 0:41:35
that justification I can understand from your perspective 
SPEAKER6 0:41:37
but everyone left 
SPEAKER4 0:41:38
and it was both 
SPEAKER3 0:41:40
it's not just just I don't want to get caught up in specifics here I don't want to get caught up in specifics 
SPEAKER5 0:41:47
we had all talked about it though 
SPEAKER6 0:41:49
that's the thing 
SPEAKER5 0:41:50
we had all talked to each other we're like hey this is a dumb decision if you want to kill yourself go ahead but we're all going to keep moving forward we specifically said that 
SPEAKER3 0:42:00
out loud in character we said that 
SPEAKER1 0:42:08
we're going to have the rules so I think that's much cooler because that's because 
SPEAKER4 0:42:14
logic takes off 
SPEAKER3 0:42:17
9 
SPEAKER1 0:42:20
so I don't know if you just weren't there or you weren't paying attention nor 
SPEAKER4 0:42:34
it's my wifi 
SPEAKER1 0:42:37
did you get that czł 
SPEAKER4 0:42:37
Wait, hello? 
SPEAKER3 0:42:39
This is my first time. 
SPEAKER5 0:42:41
They did get me the Wi-Fi booster, which was very nice of them. My landlords, they're absolutely fucking amazing. And this is my first time plugging it in, so. 
SPEAKER3 0:42:53
Plug it in. 
SPEAKER5 0:42:54
I did. I plugged it in, and it has an Ethernet port. I don't know how fast the Wi-Fi is, so I'll have to test out the speed for games later. 
SPEAKER4 0:43:03
I'm sorry to break the serious tone, but I just thought of something. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:08
Do furries say plug it in, plug it in when they're getting ready to play? I'm thinking of the tail plugs that people like. 
SPEAKER5 0:43:21
Why did my internet work to hear that sentence? And none of the rest of this conversation. 
SPEAKER4 0:43:30
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:33
I could just hear it, and then the next thing you hear is, 
SPEAKER6 0:43:36
Clap on. Clap on. 
SPEAKER3 0:43:40
Just to see it plug. 
SPEAKER5 0:43:41
Everything else has been cutting out, except that. 
SPEAKER6 0:43:48
Chizard's brain rot has passed on into the real world. 
SPEAKER4 0:43:51
I'm losing it. 
SPEAKER6 0:43:52
I'm losing it. Well, I already knew that. I'm so special that they made a separate bus for me, Devin. 
SPEAKER5 0:44:10
I get my own personal bus. 
SPEAKER3 0:44:13
Perhaps a bit shorter? 
SPEAKER5 0:44:14
As short as I am? Yes. 
SPEAKER3 0:44:17
Wait, Natalia, how tall are you? 
SPEAKER5 0:44:20
On a good day, I am 5'4". 
SPEAKER3 0:44:24
That's, like, perfectly average. 
SPEAKER5 0:44:25
That rarely happens, though, unfortunately. That's literally average. That's perfectly average, if not a little bit tall. 
SPEAKER6 0:44:32
You're almost legally a midget. 
SPEAKER5 0:44:33
You're a little bit taller than I am. 
SPEAKER6 0:44:34
I'm 5'2". 
SPEAKER4 0:44:35
I'm 5'2". 
SPEAKER5 0:44:37
What a good day. 
SPEAKER3 0:44:38
Oh, you're a perfectly good height. You're actually the perfect height. 
SPEAKER4 0:44:42
And, yeah. 
SPEAKER3 0:44:44
No, I'm not. Anything more than that would be excessive. No, we are both the perfect height for humans, and anything more than that is kind of excessive. So, it's not at all short. 
SPEAKER6 0:44:58
It's actually perfect height. 
SPEAKER2 0:44:59
I'm going to grab my snacks and we'll talk virtually quick. 
SPEAKER6 0:45:03
Hey. Get the fuck off. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:04
That's a microaggression. 
SPEAKER5 0:45:08
No, Koi, you see, this is just why you have to accumulate a lot of brothers. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:15
Accumulate? How do I just accumulate them? 
SPEAKER6 0:45:18
Don't, don't, don't. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:19
Natalia, you're going into some weird ground. Stop yourself, please. Please. 
SPEAKER5 0:45:24
I have brothers, and I have people that are basically brothers. 
SPEAKER4 0:45:29
Hmm. 
SPEAKER5 0:45:31
The issue is they're also basically my grandkids, because everybody... 
SPEAKER6 0:45:33
I'm trying to stop her. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:35
I tried to stop her. Natalia, you gotta just get rid of these steps there. 
SPEAKER2 0:45:40
What? 
SPEAKER5 0:45:41
I'm making copies for people. 
SPEAKER3 0:45:44
Natalia, have you ever heard of the Epidus Complex? Oh, please, no. 
SPEAKER6 0:45:49
No. 
SPEAKER5 0:45:51
You cut out, Koi. What did you say? 
SPEAKER3 0:45:54
Do you know what the Epidus Complex is? It's Oedipus, and also, anyway, moving straight along. Thank you. For the love of a fucking year. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:02
Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! Koi! 
SPEAKER5 0:46:08
The world needs more platonic knitting and baking, okay? 
SPEAKER3 0:46:12
Platonic knitting and baking. I love that. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:15
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 0:46:15
I'm not wrong. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:16
Is that what they call it, Natalia? How much knitting and baking is sexual, then? 
SPEAKER4 0:46:20
Is that... 
SPEAKER3 0:46:21
No, that's not what I'm going to say. Well, there is a thing called a feeder fetish, so... Yeah. What? 
SPEAKER5 0:46:28
Most people aren't into feederism. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:29
What? 
SPEAKER5 0:46:29
Yeah, you didn't know that? 
SPEAKER6 0:46:31
Most people aren't. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:31
I don't spend my time with these asscracks. crack of the internet. Most people are just into things. So usually eating's like normal and not sexual. 
SPEAKER5 0:46:41
Also knitting. Yeah, they have. That's a thing and it's really sad. 
SPEAKER3 0:46:45
Imagine trying to incorporate knitted goods. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:47
That's also why I 
SPEAKER5 0:46:49
fear many men on dating apps. 
SPEAKER6 0:46:51
Oh yeah. He's wearing my scarf. That'd be awful. 
SPEAKER5 0:46:55
Why is there a genuine copy on my character? To normalize it. Because not enough people do it. 
SPEAKER6 0:47:03
And it's sad. 
SPEAKER5 0:47:03
How are you guys able to see that shit? 
SPEAKER3 0:47:07
You shouldn't be seeing any of that. Devin, fix it. Hold on. Hold on. Take it away. Fuck all of you. 
SPEAKER6 0:47:15
I don't even exist. 
SPEAKER3 0:47:17
They're too nosy. Ban them all. 
SPEAKER5 0:47:22
I'll be right back. 
SPEAKER3 0:47:23
I need a PB&J to go with my wine. 
SPEAKER6 0:47:25
A PP&J? 
SPEAKER3 0:47:26
Really, Coy? That's what you're going to phrase it? Oh, goddammit. A PPJ. I was one second away from executing critical command. Manning Cocker. Fucking Codex. 
SPEAKER6 0:47:39
Just sitting there. 
SPEAKER2 0:47:41
All of you. 
SPEAKER3 0:47:42
I can't trust any of you. 
SPEAKER5 0:47:44
What did I do? I don't even go into the other files. I'm the one who said something. You wouldn't even know if I didn't say anything. I didn't even exist on the map, Devin. What can I say except you're welcome? 
SPEAKER3 0:47:57
No one exists on the map. 
SPEAKER6 0:47:59
What can I say except you're welcome? 
SPEAKER5 0:48:01
You're welcome. 
SPEAKER6 0:48:02
The same thing popped in my head. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:04
I'm in full control. 
SPEAKER5 0:48:07
I wish my... 
SPEAKER6 0:48:09
I wish my... 
SPEAKER5 0:48:11
I wish my monitor wouldn't tilt down. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:15
I wish I wasn't having an aneurysm with this chat. 
SPEAKER4 0:48:19
Feels like I'm in a Twitch con, like... 
SPEAKER6 0:48:22
with all the weird shit people say. 
SPEAKER5 0:48:24
I wish I didn't have to wake up tomorrow morning. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:27
I mean, you don't have to. 
SPEAKER6 0:48:28
Coy. 
SPEAKER3 0:48:28
Can you hug? 
SPEAKER4 0:48:29
Can you hug? 
SPEAKER5 0:48:31
For some baked goods? 
SPEAKER6 0:48:33
Coy, do you even call the authorities? 
SPEAKER5 0:48:35
Coy, I will make you cinnamon buns if that is what it takes. Coy, do you feel... 
SPEAKER6 0:48:41
Are you feeling depressed? 
SPEAKER5 0:48:43
Do you want to hurt yourself? 
SPEAKER4 0:48:45
I feel like normal. 
SPEAKER5 0:48:47
Wait, you can't... 
SPEAKER4 0:48:49
That's not what I asked. 
SPEAKER6 0:48:51
Coy is pretty normal when she wants to hurt herself. I don't know. What? No, you're right. I forgot. She's got a thing for it. What? 
SPEAKER3 0:49:01
I'm sorry, what? 
SPEAKER1 0:49:02
Have you seen the flogger in her room? She's crazy. 
SPEAKER3 0:49:04
Her body pillow? 
SPEAKER5 0:49:06
I've never been in the body pillow. 
SPEAKER3 0:49:08
Oh. It's in the chat somewhere. 
SPEAKER5 0:49:10
No, you don't even need a... We'll be in the room. 
SPEAKER6 0:49:13
Whatever you did, I can't log in now, Devin. Thanks. 
SPEAKER2 0:49:17
Bro, I just took all your gf's. That's it. You're fired. 
SPEAKER1 0:49:20
You just deleted my entire account, bro. 
SPEAKER2 0:49:23
Coy, Ellen's... 
SPEAKER3 0:49:25
I don't need you no longer in the match. 
SPEAKER1 0:49:29
I don't need you no longer. 
SPEAKER6 0:49:31
I'm gonna go to the bathroom. 
SPEAKER3 0:49:33
I'm gonna go to the bathroom. 
SPEAKER5 0:49:35
Oh, you sound amazing. Is Coy a robot for anybody else? 
SPEAKER3 0:49:39
Yup, Coy sounds amazing. 
SPEAKER6 0:49:40
I thought mine and mine was bad. What is... Who's playing that this year? 
SPEAKER3 0:49:45
Who are we waiting on now? Nobody. 
SPEAKER2 0:49:49
No, I was gonna ask a second question, but everyone decided to talk about knitting cakes and fucking wine and peanut butter and pee pee sandwiches. 
SPEAKER6 0:49:57
Pee pee sandwiches. 
SPEAKER5 0:49:59
There is nothing wrong with knitting things for people, okay? As long as you don't make it a fetish. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:06
But why do you have to specify that it's platonic? 
SPEAKER5 0:50:10
Also, why did you turn on Toto by Africa right when she's talking? People don't do it for each other. 
SPEAKER6 0:50:14
Toto by Africa? 
SPEAKER5 0:50:15
They don't knit things for people anymore. People just ignore each other and are mean and the world is a cruel, cruel place. Why do you have to specify that it's platonic? Because the internet is a place where everything is not platonic. There is no more... Nothing is platonic anymore. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:30
Nope. 
SPEAKER5 0:50:31
So if I am like, buy you McDonald's, is that not platonic? 
SPEAKER6 0:50:35
It is apparently hostile. 
SPEAKER5 0:50:37
I feel like at this point, you have to specify. 
SPEAKER3 0:50:39
I agree with that. It's hostile. I'd do anything for McNuggets. I'm gonna buy you McDonald's. I think we know. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:46
Anybody is hostile. 
SPEAKER5 0:50:48
I'm gonna buy you McDonald's. This is a threat. Get diabetes. 
SPEAKER2 0:50:53
I'm gonna get you McDonald's. This is a threat. We'll do unsavory things. 
SPEAKER5 0:50:57
Don't threaten me with a good time. 
SPEAKER1 0:50:59
Good lord, they're like, oh, Jesus. 
SPEAKER6 0:51:01
I'll keep my nuggets to myself. 
SPEAKER5 0:51:03
You know what, Colin? Maybe I'll retract this into a fun offer. 
SPEAKER1 0:51:06
You know what? I will buy everyone in this chat a hundred pieces of McDonald's. If you all roleplay your characters. 
SPEAKER6 0:51:13
That's all I ask. 
SPEAKER5 0:51:15
I don't need nuggets. I won't eat that. If you like, buy it over time, I'll do it. Like, ten nuggets a day, I'll do it. But I can't eat that many. 
SPEAKER3 0:51:25
And, um... 
SPEAKER5 0:51:27
They're not very good after, like, ten minutes. 
SPEAKER1 0:51:30
I thought you were gonna say ten minutes. 
SPEAKER3 0:51:32
Wait, why am I Michi old? Throw Michi new down. I didn't throw anyone down! None of you should have characters on the page! I need Michi new. 
SPEAKER5 0:51:41
I'm about to throw down. 
SPEAKER6 0:51:43
Yeah, I'm about to fucking start conniption fitting here, bud. 
SPEAKER3 0:51:45
Where are you people? Where are you talking? Why are they on the page? We better fucking start soon. Yes, I was planning on doing that. I was just gonna ask, do you guys wanna try and speed run through the town and then get back in the dungeon? Do you wanna take the money? Or do you wanna take more time? Both answers, both of them have consequences. 
SPEAKER6 0:52:03
Mari, what do you think? 
SPEAKER5 0:52:05
I, I literally can't do anything. I have no leg and no arm. 
SPEAKER3 0:52:11
Right, you. I was gonna send you something. 
SPEAKER5 0:52:14
Every night I break my leg, and every night I break my arms. Oh yeah, where's my items? 
SPEAKER6 0:52:19
My heart attacks. What items? 
SPEAKER3 0:52:21
You were supposed to send me items I was supposed to be rolling to make for this session. And you never did. 
SPEAKER1 0:52:26
Ugh. Oh my god. Dang. So. 
SPEAKER5 0:52:31
Oh, I knew I should've refilled my Gatorade before I left work. 
SPEAKER1 0:52:35
Now I'm Gatorade-less. You know what, I'll hide in the background. Anyway. 
SPEAKER5 0:52:43
Had a lot of caffeine. 
SPEAKER1 0:52:45
Michi has now made a Mechazilla. It's gonna send it down there. Michi has not in fact made a Mechazilla. 
SPEAKER3 0:52:52
It's Karjira. 
SPEAKER1 0:52:53
It's Karjira. 
SPEAKER5 0:52:54
Yuto. 
SPEAKER1 0:52:55
International copyright law. It is not Karjira. 
SPEAKER3 0:52:56
Akira. 
SPEAKER2 0:52:57
Akira. 
SPEAKER5 0:52:58
Akira. Still, we should run like it is Karjira. Anyways. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:01
Though it isn't. Anyway, yes, the reproducibility session. 
SPEAKER6 0:53:03
The session for Kuzco. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:04
It's the Janoon, Janoon copy and Mastiff. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:05
Kuzco's session. Kuzco's session. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:07
Uh. 
SPEAKER5 0:53:08
Yeah? Let fucking Missing Legs Man talk. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:10
I guess that's the only person that's gonna be able to talk to me. 
SPEAKER2 0:53:15
I guess. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:16
I think that's a good idea. 
SPEAKER6 0:53:18
I think it's a good idea. Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:20
I think it's a good idea. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:21
I think it's a good idea. 
SPEAKER6 0:53:22
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:24
I think it's a good idea. 
SPEAKER6 0:53:25
I'm not missing both of my legs. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:26
Just one singular leg. Okay? 
SPEAKER5 0:53:28
I'm missing a leg. Okay, Edward Elric. Just simmer down. We'll get you some legs. 
SPEAKER6 0:53:32
Oh my god. I am Edward. How about a wheelchair? 
SPEAKER5 0:53:35
I didn't think about that. From Twilight? 
SPEAKER6 0:53:37
Become Cyborg. Please, Devon, let us get a wheelchair with an enhancement. I already forgot which leg and which arm. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:40
Oh, it was my arm. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:41
Oh. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:42
My arm. 
SPEAKER1 0:53:43
My arm. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:44
My arm. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:45
My arm. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:46
My arm. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:47
My arm. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:48
My arm. My arm. 
SPEAKER5 0:53:50
Myolf. My arm. 
SPEAKER6 0:53:52
My arm. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:53
My arm. 
SPEAKER5 0:53:54
My arm. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:55
My arm. 
SPEAKER4 0:53:56
I remember it was my right pinky toe. I remember it was my right pinky toe. 
SPEAKER3 0:53:58
Either. Become a Cyborg monk. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:00
And then you said my full right leg. 
SPEAKER6 0:54:01
And then you said my full right leg. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:02
Which was just evil of you. 
SPEAKER3 0:54:03
Which was just evil of you. 
SPEAKER4 0:54:04
It was the opposite side of my leg. 
SPEAKER6 0:54:05
It was the opposite side of my leg. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:06
It was the opposite side of my leg. You didn't even say my right.. Okay. And then you didn't even say my right foot or my right half leg. 
SPEAKER6 0:54:10
You just said all the way up to my friggin' thigh. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:12
Like my full... 
SPEAKER4 0:54:13
Like my full... 
SPEAKER6 0:54:14
Like up to my arse. 
SPEAKER4 0:54:15
Let's think about this. Wheelchair-bound cripple with an enchantment for hover on it. 
SPEAKER6 0:54:22
Like Yoda's chair. 
SPEAKER3 0:54:23
He can kick with one leg as it floats around. 
SPEAKER6 0:54:25
Like Yoda's chair. 
SPEAKER3 0:54:27
I was going to say that or Professor X-Ass. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:32
Oh my god. 
SPEAKER1 0:54:33
Let's just change class and become 
SPEAKER3 0:54:35
Professor X. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:40
Janune's been lying to you about class this whole time. It's the long con to actually reveal the fact that Janune is 
SPEAKER1 0:54:49
Professor X. 
SPEAKER3 0:54:52
Explains the fucking accent. 
SPEAKER2 0:54:54
Professor X. 
SPEAKER5 0:54:56
Professor X. 
SPEAKER6 0:54:58
Wait, hang on. 
SPEAKER5 0:55:00
The accent's different though because Professor X doesn't talk to me. 
SPEAKER6 0:55:06
Fair. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:06
But anyways, we're getting sidetracked again. Devin? I actually do need to know, 
SPEAKER2 0:55:11
how do you want to approach your missing limbs? 
SPEAKER5 0:55:15
I told you. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:17
You did. I 
SPEAKER6 0:55:19
I expected you 
SPEAKER3 0:55:21
to come up with 
SPEAKER5 0:55:22
a way to integrate that. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:25
That is true. That is true. I have a way. It's not within a day. 
SPEAKER5 0:55:29
Yeah, I didn't expect you to be able to come up with that within a day. 
SPEAKER6 0:55:34
I just expected you to come up with it somehow. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:38
And then 
SPEAKER6 0:55:38
integrate it 
SPEAKER5 0:55:39
at some point. 
SPEAKER6 0:55:41
I got you. 
SPEAKER3 0:55:42
So you're like out for the count 
SPEAKER2 0:55:44
for large parts of this session. 
SPEAKER6 0:55:47
Yeah, I figured. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:50
Okay. Would you here? 
SPEAKER3 0:55:56
I'm going to DM you. 
SPEAKER2 0:55:57
We're going to get started first. 
SPEAKER3 0:56:00
We're going to get started and then I'll DM you. 
SPEAKER2 0:56:02
All right, here we go. 
SPEAKER3 0:56:03
Are you ready? Is everyone ready? I don't care. 
SPEAKER2 0:56:05
Let's do it. So last we left off, the Intrepid Party 
SPEAKER3 0:56:14
had gone to go rescue 
SPEAKER1 0:56:15
the two of Martha's children 
SPEAKER3 0:56:17
as well as potentially Professor Morbid 
SPEAKER1 0:56:20
all three of which were abducted by the previous party 
SPEAKER3 0:56:24
controlled by some outside enemy. 
SPEAKER2 0:56:27
You had tracked down this party 
SPEAKER3 0:56:29
known by the Wild Dogs. Gun combat would come after a bit of a 
SPEAKER1 0:56:33
little bit of a 
SPEAKER6 0:56:34
stopping 
SPEAKER3 0:56:34
and a failure to stop. Then 
SPEAKER1 0:56:37
when the Sessomere Ghosts discovered that they were fighting while they were still there only it was the first to see the cavern and discover the box that opened the cavern. They said the bomb was going to be dropped in the cavern. They discovered that 
SPEAKER2 0:56:56
maybe this was a fight 
SPEAKER1 0:56:57
that needed to be broken through more cohesionally. First was the bird that dropped well below any sort of fraction of blood bloodied and beaten before even getting a hint of progress or anything like that. 
SPEAKER3 0:57:13
Then as time went on more friends 
SPEAKER1 0:57:15
down the road came along who let you 
SPEAKER2 0:57:18
or at least 
SPEAKER3 0:57:19
detected 
SPEAKER1 0:57:19
through alternate means some paths 
SPEAKER3 0:57:22
to avoid much of the 
SPEAKER1 0:57:23
combat at least this first section. 
SPEAKER3 0:57:27
A couple of failed stealth 
SPEAKER1 0:57:28
moves later 
SPEAKER3 0:57:29
and that combat 
SPEAKER6 0:57:30
was no longer 
SPEAKER1 0:57:31
avoidable 
SPEAKER3 0:57:31
or avoided. The first to fall 
SPEAKER1 0:57:35
was Orr which is your not too far behind 
SPEAKER3 0:57:39
and unbeknownst to the party 
SPEAKER2 0:57:41
soon after 
SPEAKER3 0:57:42
was Juno. 
SPEAKER1 0:57:44
After more combat more tough decisions and a lot of stress Juno's recovered 
SPEAKER2 0:57:50
and revived 
SPEAKER3 0:57:51
and he was able 
SPEAKER1 0:57:52
to get 
SPEAKER3 0:57:53
his hands on 
SPEAKER1 0:57:54
his left leg 
SPEAKER3 0:57:55
and his right 
SPEAKER2 0:57:56
no, his right leg 
SPEAKER1 0:57:57
and his left arm 
SPEAKER3 0:57:58
one of the two alternating sides 
SPEAKER1 0:58:00
that's all that matters. 
SPEAKER6 0:58:01
It was then decided 
SPEAKER3 0:58:02
as a group 
SPEAKER1 0:58:03
that discretion 
SPEAKER2 0:58:04
was the better part of valor and you all decided to get the literal fuck out of it. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:09
Crossing over 
SPEAKER3 0:58:10
darkened woods 
SPEAKER2 0:58:11
that inhabit the havens along with the city 
SPEAKER6 0:58:14
you reach the city gates again it is at that point that the session ended. The city gates 
SPEAKER2 0:58:18
were completely 
SPEAKER1 0:58:19
empty. The city gates were empty. 
SPEAKER2 0:58:21
Now as you reach the bastions 
SPEAKER1 0:58:23
the silver metal 
SPEAKER3 0:58:25
and stone walls 
SPEAKER1 0:58:26
of the city this underground cavern 
SPEAKER2 0:58:28
the limelights 
SPEAKER3 0:58:29
come out. 
SPEAKER1 0:58:32
You return to a city 
SPEAKER3 0:58:33
that is 
SPEAKER2 0:58:34
different than what you had 
SPEAKER1 0:58:36
initially seen. 
SPEAKER3 0:58:37
When you left 
SPEAKER2 0:58:38
it was a city 
SPEAKER1 0:58:39
that very much 
SPEAKER3 0:58:40
operated the model 
SPEAKER1 0:58:41
kind of what was 
SPEAKER2 0:58:42
accepted as the norm 
SPEAKER3 0:58:43
of the cavern. 
SPEAKER2 0:58:44
While there was 
SPEAKER3 0:58:45
no real day and night there were ebbs and flows 
SPEAKER1 0:58:47
to the fluctuations of the mountain people and the dredging streets. Now as you walk 
SPEAKER3 0:58:51
and enter the city again 
SPEAKER1 0:58:52
the city is quiet there is tension many more lights are kept on than normally if there's many people in the caverns 
SPEAKER3 0:58:59
or if there's many people staying in the caverns. 
SPEAKER1 0:59:01
Now the guard presence of all of the things is varied in such stature 
SPEAKER6 0:59:05
that the regiments 
SPEAKER1 0:59:06
that you had seen 
SPEAKER2 0:59:07
drilling 
SPEAKER1 0:59:08
in the courtyards and hanging 
SPEAKER2 0:59:10
by barriers 
SPEAKER1 0:59:11
in a state of idleness 
SPEAKER2 0:59:12
now roam the streets 
SPEAKER1 0:59:13
and are now in the same state 
SPEAKER2 0:59:15
as the guards that you had seen in the caverns and in the courtyards 
SPEAKER1 0:59:19
now roam the streets in squalls and four feet 
SPEAKER3 0:59:22
all of them are 
SPEAKER1 0:59:23
part of you. 
SPEAKER3 0:59:26
Michi 
SPEAKER2 0:59:27
you would understand this 
SPEAKER1 0:59:28
in a city curtain as would you in a palace although you are not sure that it's what you are. 
SPEAKER3 0:59:36
It is back into this environment that you are 
SPEAKER1 0:59:38
all from 
SPEAKER3 0:59:39
and 
SPEAKER2 0:59:40
the rest of you 
SPEAKER3 0:59:41
have to ask 
SPEAKER1 0:59:42
what are you all to me? 
SPEAKER5 0:59:47
Hello 
SPEAKER1 0:59:48
I'm a little 
SPEAKER3 0:59:50
I'd say Isakhan's trying to assess the situation 
SPEAKER6 0:59:53
like is there anything 
SPEAKER3 0:59:54
else that he might kind of notice 
SPEAKER6 0:59:56
as he like 
SPEAKER4 0:59:57
looks around? 
SPEAKER1 0:59:58
Roll a perception check 
SPEAKER2 0:59:59
Actually Can I interrupt 
SPEAKER1 1:00:01
that perception check 
SPEAKER6 1:00:02
at the same time? Uh 
SPEAKER3 1:00:04
What are you up to? 
SPEAKER4 1:00:05
You know what 
SPEAKER2 1:00:06
I'll let you 
SPEAKER4 1:00:07
do the same 
SPEAKER3 1:00:08
Okay 
SPEAKER6 1:00:09
Go 
SPEAKER1 1:00:10

SPEAKER3 1:00:11

century itself Being Ah since I 
SPEAKER6 1:00:47
got 
SPEAKER1 1:00:47
a cup 
SPEAKER6 1:00:48
It seems suspicious. That wouldn't be my first guess. But what to get them buzzing like this is unusual. 
SPEAKER5 1:01:05
I will attempt to find out. Um, do not worry if you do not see me. 
SPEAKER6 1:01:13
Got it. You stay safe. 
SPEAKER5 1:01:16
Can I... Oh no, I don't have my character sheet. 
SPEAKER6 1:01:20
Um... 
SPEAKER5 1:01:22
Can I hide? And follow the party at a distance? 
SPEAKER2 1:01:31
Cool. 
SPEAKER5 1:01:32
I don't know how to pull up my character sheet. It's not on here. 
SPEAKER2 1:01:34
It should be on there. Go to actors. 
SPEAKER5 1:01:37
Eh... 
SPEAKER6 1:01:42
Hold on. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:42
Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
SPEAKER5 1:01:44
Ah, here it is. Hang on. No, I have it. I have it. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:51
Um... 
SPEAKER5 1:01:52
29. Oh, that's a natural 20 as well. That's handy. 
SPEAKER3 1:01:58
Ah, yeah, well, I feel extraordinary. 
SPEAKER2 1:02:03
Cool beans. 
SPEAKER5 1:02:04
I'm gonna, um, sneak along at a distance-ish so I can still watch the party. But I'm not, like, if they get picked up by the cops, I'm not with them. And I can... I want to also be scanning for other things going on. 
SPEAKER6 1:02:17
I'm not going to be going to the city. 
SPEAKER1 1:02:18
Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER6 1:02:19
As the rest of you begin to approach the gates, what do you detect? 
SPEAKER2 1:02:25
All of the guards that are there. 
SPEAKER1 1:02:28
And there is a decent convention. There are roughly 12 to 15 guards just at the gate itself. All of them being there, full-fledged, with various spears and swords and a couple of heavy crossbows. 
SPEAKER6 1:02:40
They immediately see your haggard and dragon-looking heart. And begin to approach. Who would be in the lead? Wasn't Michi in the front when we walked out? At Carrier River? Tommy, who would be in the lead? Wasn't Michi in the front when we walked out, I carry cage? 
SPEAKER3 1:03:05
I feel like Michi would be leading . So, you were out. 
SPEAKER1 1:03:08
You were in the front when you left the cave but you walked. 
SPEAKER6 1:03:11
. 
SPEAKER3 1:03:16
Oh. 
SPEAKER6 1:03:16
interested in taking the lead on this one. 
SPEAKER1 1:03:18
Well... 
SPEAKER6 1:03:25
Okay, Michi. Hold there, how goes it? 
SPEAKER2 1:03:31
Oh hello, yes, uh, you... you all... you all look really rough. Uh, are you okay? Are you guys... 
SPEAKER6 1:03:42
No. No. Where are you from? Who are you? 
SPEAKER4 1:03:48
Well, we're not from much of anywhere, but we do hear we have a place in town, if that matters. 
SPEAKER6 1:03:56
We were out adventuring and got ambushed. 
SPEAKER2 1:04:08
Michi goes and this... this half-elven figure... uh, turns around and kind of, uh, gestures to... to the figure behind them. He's a genuine armadillo master. And the rest of you are basically limping up to the next point. 
SPEAKER3 1:04:24
And he sends back, says, uh, get medical supplies, get... get something to help. 
SPEAKER2 1:04:28
These... these people need assistance. He sends back, says, unfortunately we'll need a little more dedication, uh, for, uh, to let you exit the city. 
SPEAKER6 1:04:36
Ah, yes, very well. And Michi is going to briefly show the contract. As well as the letter to the letter of the interior. 
SPEAKER2 1:04:46
Okay, I believe that you have turned over the contract to the letter of the interior to, uh, the minister. 
SPEAKER3 1:04:56
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 1:04:58
What you do have, or at least what Jizzard has, is the spell contract, and what you have is some of the mail that you need to deliver. 
SPEAKER6 1:05:04
I was... okay. Yeah, sure. I have a what? 
SPEAKER1 1:05:10
I don't remember that piece of letter. 
SPEAKER2 1:05:12
It's the one that was turned in the letter to the interior to Luentia. I thought that was part of that, but... Uh, Jizzard, you still have the quest sheet itself. With Charlotte Martin's signature and seal. 
SPEAKER1 1:05:22
Oh. Oh shit, alright. 
SPEAKER2 1:05:24
That's... that's the thing that represents you guys are on a quest. 
SPEAKER1 1:05:28
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 1:05:30
And not just random brigades. 
SPEAKER4 1:05:32
Yep. 
SPEAKER6 1:05:34
I'll procure that. 
SPEAKER2 1:05:36
Michi does not know. 
SPEAKER4 1:05:38
I don't even know I had it. Hehehe. 
SPEAKER1 1:05:42
I don't remember taking it, but I guess I got it. You ripped it off the board and brought it to her? 
SPEAKER6 1:05:48
Nope. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:05:52
I will provide it, since I have it. 
SPEAKER6 1:05:56
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:05:58
Get to roll for that encounter. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:02
I'll just hand it to Michi. 
SPEAKER6 1:06:04
What is this? I don't know what to do with this. Jizzard, any idea what this is? Can you give me some ideals? 
SPEAKER3 1:06:12
It's the contract from the lady we're helping. 
SPEAKER6 1:06:14
Oh, okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:16
Uh, sure. I guess this is our contract for doing helping. 
SPEAKER6 1:06:20
The guard says, Uh-huh. Looks him over. Looks at all of you. You're under the same circumstances as the other two. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:30
I'm not sure what to do with you. I'm not sure what to do with you. 
SPEAKER6 1:06:34
I'm not sure what to do with you. 
SPEAKER3 1:06:36
I'm not sure what to do with you. 
SPEAKER2 1:06:38
You're under the services of one Charlotte Amarr. 
SPEAKER4 1:06:42
That is correct. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:44
Yep. You were told to recover some missing individuals? 
SPEAKER6 1:06:52
Yes. That was the case. 
SPEAKER1 1:06:54
Judging from your attire, it looks like you're on a successful. 
SPEAKER6 1:07:00
We got some big problems. Yeah, we fell into that. 
SPEAKER2 1:07:04
I'm sure my commander would love to hear about it. 
SPEAKER1 1:07:06
Uh, 
SPEAKER2 1:07:08
At this point, two stretcher-bearers come out. They try to lure you, Janu, onto the line. 
SPEAKER1 1:07:14
And then, 
SPEAKER3 1:07:16
In Sahang, you're literally caged in blood. 
SPEAKER2 1:07:20
You were in puddles of blood. So they are also going to try to get you on the stretcher. They can't really tell if the blood is yours or not. 
SPEAKER1 1:07:26
He'll just kinda... 
SPEAKER3 1:07:28
...crawl. 
SPEAKER5 1:07:30
As they bring it up, he'll just willingly kinda crawl in it. 
SPEAKER3 1:07:34
And like, just sit down on top of it. ...on top of it. 
SPEAKER2 1:07:38
And then, 
SPEAKER1 1:07:40
...the trigger-tire starts to excise him. 
SPEAKER3 1:07:42
We'll let you in. 
SPEAKER2 1:07:44
Our commander will hold you in an area before we let you into the city parade. We would like to see what are some of the things you may have come into the parade. In a bit of a situation, I suppose. 
SPEAKER3 1:07:54
Could you explain what the situation is so we can make this brief? 
SPEAKER1 1:07:58
Of course. Follow me. 
SPEAKER3 1:08:00
We'll walk and talk. 
SPEAKER1 1:08:02
Um... He leads you into the... ...into the... 
SPEAKER2 1:08:08
...and basically into a set of wooden buildings. 
SPEAKER3 1:08:12
These are some of the barracks that they were drilling in earlier. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:14
But now have been converted to just holding places off. 
SPEAKER1 1:08:18
Things of that nature. 
SPEAKER2 1:08:20
While a few do still remain as barracks. You're brought into a room and sat down. He basically says on the way there, He says, 
SPEAKER6 1:08:28
The... 
SPEAKER1 1:08:30
...primary number of disappearances that we see. The news of some... ...uh... 
SPEAKER2 1:08:36
...the discovery of a group of adventurers that have been here for some time. The dead were discovered. 
SPEAKER1 1:08:44
The cultivators... ...some being or some parts of being were... ...then... ...masquerading as already... 
SPEAKER2 1:08:56
...the body statue. 
SPEAKER1 1:08:58
And... 
SPEAKER6 1:09:00
...it's... 
SPEAKER1 1:09:02
...it's gotten to the point where... 
SPEAKER2 1:09:04
...it's gotten to the point where... 
SPEAKER1 1:09:06
...it's gotten to the point where... 
SPEAKER2 1:09:08
...you'd like to... ...you'd like to... ...leave... ...the... ...raising the flag's heard. 
SPEAKER4 1:09:18
Yeah. That's... But that happened... 
SPEAKER3 1:09:26
That wouldn't be the... ...the hotel smells really bad and it's... 
SPEAKER4 1:09:30
...it's the... ...what was it called? 
SPEAKER1 1:09:34
...the opal. 
SPEAKER4 1:09:36
You know the one. Perhaps. The opal, yes. Well, before you take that, Bert, can I... ...borrow him for a second? It seems they need medical attention, you sure? 
SPEAKER2 1:09:48
It seems they need medical attention, you sure? 
SPEAKER6 1:09:50
Eee... it'll be brief, I promise. 
SPEAKER3 1:09:52
Isung-hun will look towards Michi... 
SPEAKER6 1:09:54
...and kinda look at the guards and like... 
SPEAKER3 1:09:56
...give a little nod. 
SPEAKER4 1:09:58
You're back. 
SPEAKER3 1:10:00
...and uh... slowly hop off of... 
SPEAKER4 1:10:02
...or climb off of the thing. Michi impatiently. Your bag. Quick. 
SPEAKER3 1:10:08
Uh, he'll kinda look at Michi a little... ...curiously and hesitantly... ...hold out his... 
SPEAKER6 1:10:14
...bag of holding. 
SPEAKER4 1:10:16
I promise nothing shall come up missing. 
SPEAKER6 1:10:18
I just need that one thing from it. 
SPEAKER4 1:10:22
And, uh, Michi's gonna let the bird go. ...with a nod. He's gonna kinda stand there. 
SPEAKER6 1:10:28
He wants to... 
SPEAKER3 1:10:30
He'll wait. He's kinda waiting and watching... 
SPEAKER4 1:10:32
...Michi right now. 
SPEAKER2 1:10:34
...me. Yep. The stretcher bear is kinda standing there on the ground. Are you... ...are you okay? ... ...yes. 
SPEAKER4 1:10:46
Uh... 
SPEAKER6 1:10:48
...has Michi pulled out the thing yet? Or is she still like... No. I'm waiting. 
SPEAKER4 1:10:52
... 
SPEAKER6 1:10:54
He's gonna kinda keep looking at Michi... 
SPEAKER4 1:10:56
...and kinda like... 
SPEAKER6 1:10:58
...his curiosity is... 
SPEAKER4 1:11:00
...kinda... still evident. 
SPEAKER6 1:11:02
...kinda questioning... 
SPEAKER4 1:11:04
...his look. Hm. Well. ... 
SPEAKER3 1:11:10
...worry about him in a second. He can hold on just, uh... ...a few more. produces live this long. 
SPEAKER4 1:11:14
Um, but... ...I know where you're going with this. 
SPEAKER3 1:11:18
I know what's gonna happen. So let's just get this out there. 
SPEAKER4 1:11:20
... ...we know what killed them. 
SPEAKER1 1:11:24
... 
SPEAKER2 1:11:26
... 
SPEAKER4 1:11:28
...Yes, we do. 
SPEAKER2 1:11:30
... ... 
SPEAKER4 1:11:34
... 
SPEAKER2 1:11:36
Okay. I think we have time for an Fix- ident steps. Okay. So all right... One moment... ... 
SPEAKER4 1:11:44
... 
SPEAKER3 1:11:48
All right... One moment. I'm going to give it a record. 
SPEAKER2 1:11:50
This is Ash Commander. Yep. 
SPEAKER4 1:11:54
You might wanna... 
SPEAKER2 1:11:56
He's kind of... Oh, go ahead... He... 
SPEAKER4 1:12:00
It's mainly a cop that's been rolled out on the market table, and they begin to check you over, and you start to ask, like, how did this happen? What can we do to help? And where are the pain keys? Now's your chance to do, or, you can go flaunt with them. Tease them. Wait. San's gonna kind of tilt his head like a dog when it's curious, and just keep looking at Michi a little confused. The other soldiers there with Eugenium also begin to clean the two stumps, and the stump of your arm, the lack of stump that was, you're like trying to tell us where the wounds still are. But, moving back over to the other rest of the party, a couple of moments go by, and another individual comes in. This one, not necessarily in the full regalia of the Overwatch, but they come in with a full notebook, and begin sitting down and taking notes. 
SPEAKER2 1:13:08
And the individual you're speaking to, the foreman, says, please continue. Well, start with the wild dogs. 
SPEAKER4 1:13:19
And the encounter. 
SPEAKER2 1:13:20
Oh, but for you, was this group the main group that sought them out and engaged them? 
SPEAKER6 1:13:27
You're asking if we engaged them? 
SPEAKER2 1:13:29
Yes. 
SPEAKER4 1:13:32
We had no choice. We were attacked. 
SPEAKER3 1:13:36
Yeah, we killed them. 
SPEAKER4 1:13:40
Very bluntly, yes, we did. But, there's a reason. Let me get to that. 
SPEAKER2 1:13:48
Okay, so... 
SPEAKER4 1:13:49
So, we found this group that apparently was a part of the kidnapping. 
SPEAKER6 1:13:55
We found out they smell terribly bad, actually. 
SPEAKER4 1:14:00
And there was some weird, almost like a briny substance on them. 
SPEAKER3 1:14:09
Which kind of threw us off guard. We were kind of confused about that. So, we decided to continue our hunt to find her children. Am I missing anything, guys? 
SPEAKER6 1:14:19
So, we did find... 
SPEAKER4 1:14:21
Their hideout, which was in this room. 
SPEAKER3 1:14:24
We went to confront them. And, well, they tried to lodge an axe in everybody. 
SPEAKER4 1:14:34
So, they were not very hospitable. 
SPEAKER3 1:14:39
Yeah, they didn't really talk to us very much. 
SPEAKER4 1:14:41
They kind of just... 
SPEAKER6 1:14:43
And that was about it. 
SPEAKER3 1:14:46
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 1:14:48
So, it was... 
SPEAKER2 1:14:49
It was them that sought you out first. 
SPEAKER3 1:14:52
They sought out the children, and we sought out to finding them to get some answers to see if they might know. 
SPEAKER6 1:15:01
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:15:02
Uh, but, when we did, and then Michi's gonna kind of give this grotesque leaguer and slam this thing on the fucking floor. It's just the brain monster looking thing. 
SPEAKER6 1:15:13
Oh, Jesus! The fuck is that? And, uh, each one of them was... 
SPEAKER4 1:15:19
Dubiously intent. So, as far as we can gather, those who were infected are kind of simple. 
SPEAKER3 1:15:30
But, this is why I say those in wraps in here should probably be in wraps and not be told to anybody else. 
SPEAKER2 1:15:40
The soldier looks to the other individual scribe. 
SPEAKER1 1:15:46
Uh... 
SPEAKER2 1:15:47
Seems to be... 
SPEAKER3 1:15:48
They both have this... 
SPEAKER2 1:15:49
Ghastly expression on their face. They're just staring at it now. 
SPEAKER1 1:15:54
Um... 
SPEAKER4 1:15:54
And... Looks... 
SPEAKER3 1:15:57
Looks down at it. 
SPEAKER2 1:15:58
Looks at both of you. In fact, at all of you again. What the fuck is this? 
SPEAKER3 1:16:05
Michi's gonna throw it at them. Well, that came out of them. 
SPEAKER2 1:16:08
That came out of them. 
SPEAKER6 1:16:10
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 1:16:11
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 1:16:11
And Michi's gonna toss the other bodies from her bag onto the floor next to it. 
SPEAKER3 1:16:15
Their heads went pop. Weirdly. 
SPEAKER4 1:16:17
Kind of grotesquely. No, they may look cute, but they are actually quite dangerous. 
SPEAKER3 1:16:25
No, no, I think... 
SPEAKER4 1:16:26
I wouldn't define that as... 
SPEAKER3 1:16:28
Yeah, you find that cute. 
SPEAKER2 1:16:30
Uh... 
SPEAKER3 1:16:31
Mm. 
SPEAKER6 1:16:32
I... 
SPEAKER3 1:16:33
Well, they're not standing up properly right now. 
SPEAKER4 1:16:35
You had to be there. 
SPEAKER1 1:16:40
Uh... 
SPEAKER4 1:16:41
He looks down and looks like... 
SPEAKER1 1:16:44
This... This is... 
SPEAKER2 1:16:46
This is of my degree. And he looks over at the... 
SPEAKER4 1:16:51
The scribe, essentially. 
SPEAKER2 1:16:53
Looks like they are one second away from the cute guy. Like, actively looking over, then reaching a bit. And... 
SPEAKER1 1:17:00
He's like... 
SPEAKER2 1:17:01
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:17:03
You wanted answers? 
SPEAKER6 1:17:06
Or you had questions? 
SPEAKER3 1:17:07
We had answers? And we're honest. We are not a sponge. Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:17:13
Make a perception check with advantage. 
SPEAKER4 1:17:18
Ooh. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:17:20
All of us or just him? 
SPEAKER1 1:17:23
I think all of us. 
SPEAKER3 1:17:24
Yeah, let's go. 
SPEAKER6 1:17:25
We're all here. 
SPEAKER5 1:17:26
Yippee! 
SPEAKER3 1:17:27
Sunk on two, yeah. 
SPEAKER5 1:17:28
Does that include me? 
SPEAKER2 1:17:30
You are in a different room, unfortunately. 
SPEAKER6 1:17:33
Uh... 
SPEAKER4 1:17:34
Can you put my new character... 
SPEAKER5 1:17:35
Can I make a perception check in my room? 
SPEAKER3 1:17:37
Sure. 
SPEAKER6 1:17:39
Yay! 
SPEAKER3 1:17:40
I don't have access... 
SPEAKER6 1:17:41
I can't participate. To my character sheet. Can you put it... 
SPEAKER4 1:17:44
Or give me, uh... 
SPEAKER3 1:17:46
Ownership? 
SPEAKER4 1:17:47
So I can actually open it up. It's not the one that says Michi old. 
SPEAKER6 1:17:51
It's the Michi Michi. No, it should be under player characters. Just Michi. 
SPEAKER4 1:18:02
Because remember I had a... 
SPEAKER6 1:18:03
Mine got fucked up. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:07
Yeah, but I only see Michi. 
SPEAKER4 1:18:09
Yeah, just... 
SPEAKER3 1:18:10
That's the one. I don't have access to Michi. You have owner on. 
SPEAKER4 1:18:19
Are you high? 
SPEAKER3 1:18:21
Under... 
SPEAKER4 1:18:22
Oh, there it is. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:23
Okay, now I see it. 
SPEAKER6 1:18:26
I swear I'm not Bethel today. 
SPEAKER4 1:18:32
Is this an insight check? 
SPEAKER2 1:18:35
No, it's... It's persuasion. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:37
Oh, it's a persuasion. I thought you said perception. It's persuasion for everyone except for Janune. 
SPEAKER2 1:18:42
Janune, it is perception. 
SPEAKER6 1:18:45
I swear you said perception. Hmm? 
SPEAKER4 1:18:49
With advantage. 
SPEAKER2 1:18:55
Everyone except for Janune is persuasion. 
SPEAKER3 1:18:59
I'll roll a plus. 
SPEAKER6 1:19:00
Where you said perception. Let me do persuasion. That's why I asked for perception. 
SPEAKER4 1:19:06
Is this... 
SPEAKER3 1:19:11
There's something on this shirt. 
SPEAKER5 1:19:12
I don't even remember getting this shirt. Why do I have this shirt? I don't even think it's mine. 
SPEAKER6 1:19:17
My eyes rolled. It's dirty. It's dirty. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:20
It also says Michi Gold in your character sheet. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:24
Yeah, because I'm trying to fucking select it 
SPEAKER4 1:19:25
because the thing is not on the fucking board 
SPEAKER6 1:19:29
so I can't actually click on Michi to make it the new selected token. 
SPEAKER4 1:19:38
So if you could put it down on the board 
SPEAKER6 1:19:39
at some point, that'd be cool. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:41
Okay, fine. Fine. 
SPEAKER5 1:19:45
Another. 
SPEAKER2 1:19:47
Year one. 
SPEAKER3 1:19:49
There's that one. 
SPEAKER6 1:19:51
Now let's see if it works. 
SPEAKER5 1:19:56
Goddamn, how do I roll a 12 twice? 
SPEAKER3 1:19:58
Jesus Christ. Alright, fuck it. It's still a 13 anyway. 
SPEAKER5 1:20:02
The same way that I rolled a nat 1 
SPEAKER6 1:20:04
like three times. And a nat 20 like three times. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:10
You want that one. 
SPEAKER4 1:20:15
Okay. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:16
Not too high of a DC on this one. You essentially... Honestly, the entire time 
SPEAKER2 1:20:20
they whipped out the bodies of everything you killed. What's it all doing? Let's continue and we'll probably have to repeat all of this again. 
SPEAKER4 1:20:36
Someone at much higher level. 
SPEAKER3 1:20:39
Yeah, but... 
SPEAKER2 1:20:41
You... 
SPEAKER4 1:20:42
So you sought out this group 
SPEAKER2 1:20:45
and you checked it. 
SPEAKER4 1:20:47
Attacked them. 
SPEAKER6 1:20:48
Killed them. 
SPEAKER4 1:20:49
And then... 
SPEAKER6 1:20:53
What? 
SPEAKER4 1:20:54
We went following the potential lead 
SPEAKER3 1:21:00
that they were in a tunnel nearby. 
SPEAKER4 1:21:04
But once again, please, with nuance, do not spill this 
SPEAKER6 1:21:11
because if this is the case 
SPEAKER4 1:21:12
and you're saying that there's other people, 
SPEAKER6 1:21:15
we don't need any other problems, if you know. 
SPEAKER4 1:21:19
Like, with whatever these things are finding out. 
SPEAKER2 1:21:23
With all due respect to the party and your adventure and ability, given the fact that this is a continuity problem and looking at, frankly, the state that you all are in, it looks like the case needs to go up. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:39
It does. 
SPEAKER4 1:21:40
But... 
SPEAKER2 1:21:40
Subtly, perhaps, but it does. 
SPEAKER6 1:21:42
Subtly. Carefully. If they seem odd, acting odd, 
SPEAKER4 1:21:47
don't trust it. 
SPEAKER3 1:21:52
Michi's gonna give a tinfoil hat stare. Go ahead and make an inside check. 
SPEAKER6 1:21:56
What is a tinfoil hat stare? 
SPEAKER4 1:22:00
What's that? 
SPEAKER5 1:22:01
What is a tinfoil hat stare? What does that look like? Do you have a picture of that? 
SPEAKER3 1:22:05
Have you ever seen Dale Dribble? 
SPEAKER5 1:22:07
No, I don't even know what that is. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:09
Oh, no. From King of the Hill? 
SPEAKER5 1:22:14
I don't watch King of the Hill. I just know... 
SPEAKER4 1:22:16
What's... 
SPEAKER6 1:22:18
I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:19
Do I look like a... 
SPEAKER5 1:22:20
Oh, I know what a... 
SPEAKER6 1:22:23
What does it say? 
SPEAKER5 1:22:23
I just want a picture of a gosh-dang hot dog. It's the stare. Oh, do I look like I know what a JPEG is? I just want a picture of a gosh-dang hot dog. 
SPEAKER6 1:22:34
That image is what a fucking tinfoil hat stare is like. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:37
You question everybody and the reality of which it is. 
SPEAKER5 1:22:41
Okay, hold on. 
SPEAKER4 1:22:42
Let me... 
SPEAKER5 1:22:42
I'm organizing while I'm playing, since I'm not gonna be... doing much anyways. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:50
What did you say this was, Devin? An insight check? I don't know. Okay. 
SPEAKER6 1:22:54
Oh my gosh, that's beautiful. 
SPEAKER3 1:22:56
I'm rolling with advantage. 
SPEAKER2 1:22:59
Why do you have advantage? Hold on. 
SPEAKER3 1:23:01
It's stone rune. Insight or persuasion? Insight. Why do you have advantage? 
SPEAKER6 1:23:06
Because it's stone rune. 
SPEAKER3 1:23:08
When inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on wisdom. Insight checks. 
SPEAKER2 1:23:12
Oh. 
SPEAKER6 1:23:12
Oh. 
SPEAKER4 1:23:16
God damn it. 
SPEAKER3 1:23:21
Wow. 
SPEAKER6 1:23:23
That's a 22. 
SPEAKER1 1:23:30
Um... 
SPEAKER3 1:23:31
You get the... 
SPEAKER4 1:23:32
You get a perception. 
SPEAKER2 1:23:33
You get a read on this guy. And... 
SPEAKER4 1:23:37
A couple of things stand out. 
SPEAKER2 1:23:42
First, compared to a lot of the other servers that you've seen, 
SPEAKER6 1:23:46
you get a perception. 
SPEAKER2 1:23:46
You get a perception. 
SPEAKER6 1:23:46
You get a perception. You get a perception. 
SPEAKER2 1:23:46
Around before you left. 
SPEAKER3 1:23:50
This one carries themselves 
SPEAKER2 1:23:51
to the table. They're in some position of authority to tell that immediately. They are also trying to fight with them, retaining the conclusion that they still have play. There's a hint of paranoia there. They're hiding it very well. And when they say that they're going to the cell and bring it up, they really do mean 
SPEAKER4 1:24:14
that at this point, 
SPEAKER2 1:24:16
they're... The realization is well beyond 
SPEAKER4 1:24:18
just a drill 
SPEAKER2 1:24:20
or just something small is setting it. 
SPEAKER6 1:24:24
Hmm. 
SPEAKER1 1:24:30
So... 
SPEAKER2 1:24:31
They look at someone who's probably going to help rather than, you know, have a thing erupt out of their head. 
SPEAKER4 1:24:38
Understood. Well, I trust you know what you're doing. So, with that... 
SPEAKER6 1:24:43
I'm back. 
SPEAKER4 1:24:44
If we could... 
SPEAKER2 1:24:45
Welcome back. 
SPEAKER4 1:24:45
...probably get things resolved 
SPEAKER3 1:24:48
because I don't think these things are just going to stop now that we know where they potentially might be. 
SPEAKER2 1:24:53
Yes, please continue. You said you had a... Where did this thing come from? 
SPEAKER3 1:24:56
Where did it go? 
SPEAKER4 1:24:57
Chizard, that's your cue. Lead to the tunnel? 
SPEAKER3 1:25:05
There's a tunnel? There's a tunnel that goes into the dark 
SPEAKER4 1:25:09
and it goes deeper and deeper. We got that in the journal 
SPEAKER6 1:25:15
they left. 
SPEAKER3 1:25:15
Behind. 
SPEAKER6 1:25:17
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER4 1:25:19
That hinted towards a... 
SPEAKER6 1:25:20
That tunnel we just talked about. Yep. Michi's going to briefly hand it over. I'm going to need that back. 
SPEAKER3 1:25:27
Actually, you know what? As long as you make me a copy, I don't care. Doesn't Nisanhan have it? 
SPEAKER4 1:25:32
Uh, no. 
SPEAKER6 1:25:33
I think Michi's while I got the book, wasn't it? 
SPEAKER3 1:25:36
Let me double check my inventory in. 
SPEAKER4 1:25:41
Because I looted it off a corpse when I got the first reserve. Uh ilkuidizouki Theciplier 
SPEAKER1 1:25:48
Well, the thing is, 
SPEAKER6 1:25:49
is Nisanhan languish it 
SPEAKER4 1:25:51
while the save source locating 
SPEAKER3 1:25:52
but you could have 
SPEAKER4 1:25:53
access in other touslephs 
SPEAKER3 1:25:54
Let's focus on 1973 
SPEAKER6 1:25:55
himself as well. 
SPEAKER1 1:25:55
I suppose I haven't attended theandais�� Um... 
SPEAKER2 1:26:01
Isn't it related 
SPEAKER3 1:26:02
to the 
SPEAKER2 1:26:04
As I'm not sure 
SPEAKER4 1:26:07
It who can know 
SPEAKER1 1:26:11
Um, is that 
SPEAKER3 1:26:14
what ANA 
SPEAKER2 1:26:15
This is evidence of you. 
SPEAKER3 1:26:18
But you were led to a tunnel. 
SPEAKER2 1:26:20
You went into it. 
SPEAKER3 1:26:23
We did. Very hesitantly, some of us preparing more than others. 
SPEAKER4 1:26:30
That's kind of why we're in bad shape. 
SPEAKER2 1:26:34
Clearly. What did you find there? What are we dealing with? 
SPEAKER3 1:26:39
You know what? Hold on. Can I... You know what? Do you not mind me? It might still be fresh enough to eat, actually. And Michi's gonna slap the fucking rovers in. This trigger bolt I'm gonna stab at an inch backwards. 
SPEAKER2 1:26:51
This one figure puts his hand on his sword. 
SPEAKER3 1:26:55
Oh, no worries. They're dead. 
SPEAKER4 1:26:59
Michi's just gonna pull the shish kebab-ed-ass fucking rovers out. 
SPEAKER3 1:27:03
Ah, here they are. 
SPEAKER2 1:27:06
You pull what remains of two large rovers. These rovers, given their natural state and their physicality they have, are larger than you are. Hmm. Like, rovers are not small creatures. These are person-sized creatures. 
SPEAKER4 1:27:22
You dump two person-sized corpses out of your bag. 
SPEAKER3 1:27:30
Which, at this point, gets a reaction. 
SPEAKER2 1:27:33
It makes them back up to the wall. It's like, what? 
SPEAKER3 1:27:38
Okay, what else do you have in that bag? 
SPEAKER1 1:27:42
Um... 
SPEAKER4 1:27:43
Not enough. But enough. 
SPEAKER2 1:27:45
What else? 
SPEAKER3 1:27:47
What else is in there? Oh, nothing dead. I mean, that's the last of it. 
SPEAKER6 1:27:51
I was just keeping up from potential food, maybe. I don't know what this thing is, really. Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:27:57
Okay. But the brains? 
SPEAKER3 1:28:01
Weird things. They possess people, apparently. And these two guys. 
SPEAKER4 1:28:05
But we know there's potentially more down there. A lot more. 
SPEAKER3 1:28:13
Okay, so you think that these things, 
SPEAKER2 1:28:15
these things, these gestures at the... With the tip of the sword. Gestures at the corpse with the rope on the ground. They ate these people. 
SPEAKER4 1:28:25
They've eaten many people. 
SPEAKER2 1:28:29
When the children are gone. As well as everyone else. 
SPEAKER4 1:28:33
We don't know that. 
SPEAKER3 1:28:36
We didn't get too far before we found our friends injured. 
SPEAKER2 1:28:41
Right. Or, um... 
SPEAKER4 1:28:45
Tabaxi, right? In fact, maybe we should ask questions to the tabaxi 
SPEAKER3 1:28:50
and see if they've seen anything else. 
SPEAKER4 1:28:54
They got... 
SPEAKER2 1:28:55
That would be important. 
SPEAKER4 1:29:00
You were saying? Oh, no. 
SPEAKER6 1:29:02
That's a good answer. 
SPEAKER3 1:29:04
That's exactly what I was going to say. 
SPEAKER2 1:29:11
It's thoughtful for a moment. 
SPEAKER4 1:29:14
Janine, while this is going on, 
SPEAKER2 1:29:15
your perception check. You... 
SPEAKER5 1:29:19
Oh. 
SPEAKER2 1:29:21
You're trying to just look around the room and see what's in there? 
SPEAKER5 1:29:26
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 1:29:28
Okay, 23. 
SPEAKER3 1:29:30
This is kind of a building 
SPEAKER2 1:29:32
that's been converted into a command center as well. Under normal circumstances, it's just one long, hollow building with cots and beds and bunks on every... on going and progressing down the road. 
SPEAKER6 1:29:45
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:29:45
So, the whole building is... It's pretty close. 
SPEAKER3 1:29:47
Yeah. You can see that, 
SPEAKER2 1:29:48
because you can see the walls, and there's a lot of work going on here. So, it's a lot of work to do. So, the building is... 
SPEAKER1 1:29:52
It's quite a large building. 
SPEAKER2 1:29:53
It's a lot of work to do. However, you can clearly see as well into some of the other areas of this building. 
SPEAKER3 1:29:59
There aren't any other people 
SPEAKER2 1:30:01
that are injured right now in your area. And as the... You can assume healers or some sort of medical physicians, medical officers, 
SPEAKER3 1:30:09
are cleaning your wounds 
SPEAKER2 1:30:11
and trying to figure out to make sure that everything is sealed up. 
SPEAKER3 1:30:13
The first thing you notice is you're looking at a little bit more of a... 
SPEAKER4 1:30:15
looking at yourself. The resurrection magic is not human magic. The restorative powers that it has are limited. Your leg is a stump with a ragged scar over the entirety of the open socket that 
SPEAKER2 1:30:32
was where your hip is. I say stump, but that's incorrect. I say just the socket. 
SPEAKER4 1:30:37
It is discolored and is mangled, but it is closed. About two inches above that on the opposite side of your body and extended all the way up across parts of your chest to where the 
SPEAKER2 1:30:51
small stump of your arm is. It's a massive scar or a bunch of flesh is going away. You can see the skeletal structure underneath as a very thin layer of skin now covers it. 
SPEAKER4 1:31:05
Question. Yes. Um, so am I in pain then? 
SPEAKER2 1:31:18
I would say yes, you are in a very decent amount of pain. 
SPEAKER4 1:31:23
Okay. Good to know. At this point, pretty much everything that is going on feels numb and dull to you. You're in 
SPEAKER3 1:31:36
enough pain that you just... 
SPEAKER4 1:31:37
I'm in a state of adrenaline rush. Yeah. Adrenaline rush or going in into and staying in shock. Essentially. 
SPEAKER2 1:31:52
At this point, they're trying to wrap and clean the wounds, get you out of that state of shock, 
SPEAKER4 1:31:57
and you're not having a great time. What you notice outside of just your physicality 
SPEAKER2 1:32:04
is over to your left, 
SPEAKER1 1:32:06
there is a lot of pain, but you're not having a great time. You're just not feeling good, and you're not feeling good at all. You're just not feeling good. You're just not feeling good. 
SPEAKER3 1:32:07
It's really just a matter of time before you get to the point where you can really get out of it. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:07
There is a small part of this area that has been turned into almost a command center. 
SPEAKER4 1:32:11
There are various maps that are put up on the wall with people cross-checking and marking locations. It appears to be a map of the city, a map of the city's sewer system, and a map of one that's more familiar, 
SPEAKER2 1:32:28
a map of the different known caverns that were around in this large cave-like state. 
SPEAKER1 1:32:34
Okay. And you can tell that they have a lot of people. They're all in there. They're all in there. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:32:36
So, I'm not sure if you can see them, but they're all in there. 
SPEAKER6 1:32:36
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:32:36
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 1:32:36
Okay. Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:32:41
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 1:32:42
Okay. Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:32:42
Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:32:43
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:33:01
Okay. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:33:03
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:33:06
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:33:06
Okay. 
SPEAKER6 1:33:07
music stopped playing. For the rest of the official says, I, before we interrogate your Tibet, some introductions are in order. I am Birat Tar. I am, you will know me as a 
SPEAKER2 1:33:30
Lieutenant Kapitali, commander of this segment of the wall. After we interrogate your Tibet's Tibet's friend, I intend to alert all the MyChen command. This is a big enough issue now where I believe the point's a more immediate resolution. Honestly, I don't have the pull to get you the help you need or get these people mobilized. 
SPEAKER1 1:34:00
But I know people can help you. 
SPEAKER3 1:34:02
We can make that a rush. That'd be great. Time is of the essence. 
SPEAKER2 1:34:05
Of course. Um, and all of your names are my name. And your group name. Who might, who might find the pleasure or displeasure of working with me? As he looks at the corpses on the ground now. 
SPEAKER6 1:34:21
Well, these guys here on the floor, they're, I don't know, medical boys. And my name is Mechi. 
SPEAKER1 1:34:27
Mechi of... Mechi of the Black Forest.

Mechi of the Black Forest. 
SPEAKER1 1:34:29
Mechi of the Black Forest. 
SPEAKER3 1:34:29
Mechi of the Black Forest. Mechi of the Black Forest.

SPEAKER6 1:36:47
45 
SPEAKER5 1:36:52
and one of my . 13 Hanging back, following from a distance. I'm not going to go inside the building, but I'll sort of hang around. Just see what happens. 
SPEAKER3 1:37:07
See how long it takes for them to get talked to. 
SPEAKER5 1:37:09
Try and get a vibe check going on. 
SPEAKER2 1:37:12
At this point, it's about 30 minutes gone since they've gone into the building itself. 
SPEAKER3 1:37:17
They didn't look like they were in any sort of... 
SPEAKER2 1:37:20
Like there was any hostile action being prepared. 
SPEAKER3 1:37:26
As time passes... 
SPEAKER5 1:37:28
Are there any guards on the outside of the building? 
SPEAKER3 1:37:31
Yes. There are... 
SPEAKER2 1:37:33
You're kind of under a windowsill next to it, kind of hidden behind a bush, if anything. 
SPEAKER3 1:37:38
There are guards all over the city. 
SPEAKER2 1:37:41
They're easily 20 to 30 between where the gate was and just wheeling around these buildings. 
SPEAKER3 1:37:49
Miki is going to kind of make a joke. 
SPEAKER4 1:37:52
Well, if my friend did survive, 
SPEAKER3 1:37:55
they should be... joining us shortly. You seem nice enough. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:02
Hinting that, you know, the earbud is still in. 
SPEAKER5 1:38:07
Are you passing the message to me? 
SPEAKER3 1:38:11
Yeah, the earring's still on, so I'm just speaking aloud. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:14
You can still hear it. 
SPEAKER3 1:38:16
Ah, okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:38:17
Is that like a general open channel walkie-talkie, or do you have to intentionally send messages? 
SPEAKER6 1:38:23
Ooh, good question, Devin. 
SPEAKER3 1:38:25
So... 
SPEAKER2 1:38:26
That is supposed to... What that is supposed to do to make a replicate is ultimately send you to them. But that can usually do to me. I would speak your bad word, or do something I could, and then go through the process of sending. 
SPEAKER1 1:38:42
So just by speaking that in the world, that would actually send a message. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:47
Never mind that. 
SPEAKER1 1:38:47
I would like to hear your comments on what your actions would be before starting that. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:53
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:38:53
So... 
SPEAKER2 1:38:55
Starting that up. 
SPEAKER6 1:38:56
How we're going to do this. 
SPEAKER1 1:38:58
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 1:38:59
So what I'm saying is, do it in a funny way. 
SPEAKER1 1:39:01
And any time you're going to do it, you're going to do it in a funny way. 
SPEAKER5 1:39:06
Yeah, just make it something inconspicuous. 
SPEAKER6 1:39:09
Okay, Google. 
SPEAKER5 1:39:11
I feel like it could... could it be something like pressing, like, two of your fingers, like your thumb and like your middle finger together? That way you don't have to like obviously reach up and touch an ear, or like... If you're like, theoretically, if you're like cuffed to a wall, you could still like... 
SPEAKER6 1:39:24
... ... ... 
SPEAKER5 1:39:26
I'm just thinking about the criminal applications of this. 
SPEAKER1 1:39:28
Well, of course you could. 
SPEAKER5 1:39:30
I mean... I mean, it is my job, and I am quite good at it. 
SPEAKER6 1:39:34
If she fits... 
SPEAKER5 1:39:35
If she fits where, Cinderella? 
SPEAKER4 1:39:40
You know, I kinda... kinda like that idea. 
SPEAKER6 1:39:43
We can come back to that, but... 
SPEAKER2 1:39:45
Okay, so you're going to knock that thing. 
SPEAKER6 1:39:50
Okay. What do you think about the pinky of your thumb? Because I kinda like that idea. 
SPEAKER5 1:39:55
Um... sure. That one's... that one would keep it from being, um, unintentional. But it would be a little bit more difficult, like... It could be more difficult to do. 
SPEAKER6 1:40:06
It could be more difficult to do. Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 1:40:08
Because wielding a sword you can kind of... 
SPEAKER5 1:40:10
Because pinky to thumb is a further stretch than any of the other fingers. 
SPEAKER6 1:40:13
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 1:40:14
Like, if you... even ring finger to thumb is easier than pinky. 
SPEAKER1 1:40:17
Alright. 
SPEAKER5 1:40:18
You can make it like tapping your toe. 
SPEAKER1 1:40:20
Unless you don't have toes to tap. That's true. 
SPEAKER3 1:40:25
That's true. 
SPEAKER5 1:40:26
It's not a burn! I change shape! That is me! 
SPEAKER6 1:40:30
Sometimes I don't have toes! 
SPEAKER3 1:40:31
Jesus. 
SPEAKER6 1:40:33
Sometimes I don't have toes, okay?! Michi's gonna press her fucking thumb to her pinky and be saying this then. 
SPEAKER1 1:40:41
As you're being examined by the fact that you're a pirate, it's not a sin. Pirates can't be pirates. There's no... 
SPEAKER3 1:40:51
There's no... 
SPEAKER6 1:40:52
There's no... 
SPEAKER5 1:40:53
You know, I... That is not what I meant! 
SPEAKER1 1:41:01
Oh... 
SPEAKER3 1:41:07
It's like Koi's roommate saying that? 
SPEAKER5 1:41:09
Um... is... Are we fucking sitting on Janine? 
SPEAKER1 1:41:15
Okay, um... 
SPEAKER3 1:41:16
So I'm gonna say... 
SPEAKER1 1:41:19
Horse? 
SPEAKER2 1:41:20
I'm sorry to say sorry but nothing much to catch... 
SPEAKER1 1:41:22
So far, we'll quickly pop to the sun. Before you really do that, you're going to have to party. And party to see more alive. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:42
Sun-Khan kind of looks himself over, looks at the massive amount of blood kicked on him, some of it his and some not, and kind of assess his own condition. 
SPEAKER1 1:41:56
Let me see. 
SPEAKER3 1:41:58
He kind of will stop to look over himself, hold his arms out, and then he looks at the guy and kind of motions like when you kind of hold your hand out in the air and kind of move it side to side, 
SPEAKER6 1:42:16
like that type of... 
SPEAKER2 1:42:20
So, while you are back in your... Uh, how great is that? 
SPEAKER4 1:42:27
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 1:42:28
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER3 1:42:44
Okay. 
SPEAKER4 1:42:50
Even with the prepuative wound closure, 
SPEAKER3 1:42:57
I still have wounds? 
SPEAKER4 1:42:58
You still have wounds, 
SPEAKER2 1:43:00
but they have to close enough to not cause them. But there's a big reason for the wound closing. 
SPEAKER4 1:43:07
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER2 1:43:10
Like, you're not... That's the prepuative wound closure. Not the knee wound closure. Not the knee blood. The skin can't be formed. 
SPEAKER4 1:43:20
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 1:43:21
However, 
SPEAKER2 1:43:23
this is a one-time-a-cómo selection. So, if... And you probably do the dry lube. Mm-hmm. And the feeling is the blood volumizing and the words of the stretcher. That... 
SPEAKER6 1:43:48
Certainly. 
SPEAKER2 1:43:49
 
SPEAKER4 1:43:50
He's gonna kinda shiver from the shock of that and then shake himself off like a dog when they're shaking themselves dry. Just watches the blood drain curiously like oh shit. 
SPEAKER2 1:44:39
Alot of things happening right now. But, it just makes you impressive , it's not cool. Słada is just going to be one of those real good friends. 
SPEAKER1 1:45:06
That's it. 
SPEAKER2 1:45:08
Next. I apologize. Do you have allies or a combination in the city? Would Ms. Charlotte be interested in having this update as well? 
SPEAKER3 1:45:34
Let's not concern her with the details. 
SPEAKER6 1:45:36
We don't need her panicking and making any rash decisions. 
SPEAKER4 1:45:39
But if you want to, that is your call. 
SPEAKER3 1:45:44
That is your city. As for accommodations, we do have. 
SPEAKER6 1:45:49
We do need to prepare for ourselves, if you don't mind. 
SPEAKER2 1:45:55
In what way? 
SPEAKER6 1:45:58
Healing, getting a shower, anything of the sorts. 
SPEAKER2 1:46:04
Well, as soon as... As soon as my... 
SPEAKER1 1:46:08
As soon as my... 
SPEAKER2 1:46:09
As soon as my... As soon as my... 
SPEAKER3 1:46:18
Very well. 
SPEAKER4 1:46:19
Or, could you have anybody accommodate with us while we do our thing? 
SPEAKER2 1:46:26
Okay. Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 1:46:39
I need to start smoking. 
SPEAKER5 1:46:47
Woo, throat cancer. So exciting. 
SPEAKER4 1:46:54
I mean, 
SPEAKER5 1:46:56
it's still cancer. 
SPEAKER6 1:47:00
You'll get cancer. 
SPEAKER3 1:47:03
I can't believe I fucking 
SPEAKER6 1:47:04
vaped in high school. 
SPEAKER1 1:47:05
It's so cringy. 
SPEAKER2 1:47:07
You can see that. 
SPEAKER4 1:47:09
It was like for like one month though. 
SPEAKER5 1:47:15
There are people that vape in college, so. 
SPEAKER3 1:47:17
Yeah. When I was in Korea, there was a vape vending machine 
SPEAKER6 1:47:21
and I saw like, it was just 
SPEAKER3 1:47:22
really popular. 
SPEAKER5 1:47:24
They're less, um, less strong though in other countries because they have limits. 
SPEAKER4 1:47:31
That makes sense. 
SPEAKER5 1:47:33
I want to say 5% nicotine in the US and they can't be more than 
SPEAKER3 1:47:37
2 in other countries. 
SPEAKER2 1:47:39
Hey yo, remember one of the strongest nicotine? 
SPEAKER6 1:47:41
Do it yourself. Do it yourself. 
SPEAKER5 1:47:45
Cause I was, um, when I was backpacking, I was, there was a girl from the US that was addicted to vapes and the one that she'd brought from the US died? Ran out? Whatever they do. 
SPEAKER4 1:47:55
Um, and 
SPEAKER5 1:47:57
she like had to do two at once of the Spanish ones because they were not strong enough 
SPEAKER6 1:48:01
apparently. 
SPEAKER5 1:48:03
It was absolutely wild. 
SPEAKER2 1:48:05
It was absolutely wild. 
SPEAKER4 1:48:07
Can you imagine that level of, like, 
SPEAKER6 1:48:09
addiction though? That's crazy. Well, but it's also like, people don't really, like, 
SPEAKER5 1:48:19
talk about it as much. There's not really support for it. 
SPEAKER4 1:48:23
Like, to help people. 
SPEAKER5 1:48:25
We just generally don't help people anymore. A society is kind of awful. 
SPEAKER4 1:48:29
It's okay. 
SPEAKER3 1:48:31
Soon you'll learn that it's 
SPEAKER4 1:48:33
always been awful. 
SPEAKER5 1:48:35
Has always- Well, okay, I will say it hasn't always been awful, okay? There were certain times, there were certain times when people were just living in the moment, enjoying life, like the raid on Lindisfarne, okay? No cell phones, 
SPEAKER1 1:48:47
no vapes, just 
SPEAKER4 1:48:49
living in the moment. 
SPEAKER2 1:48:51
Very stupid. Yeah, 
SPEAKER5 1:48:55
just the raid on Lindisfarne. 
SPEAKER2 1:48:57
The good old thing. Yeah, 
SPEAKER6 1:49:01
no, no, no, I mean, and the only 
SPEAKER5 1:49:03
reason why the raid on Lindisfarne counts is because 
SPEAKER6 1:49:05
like, are we sure that Catholics are real? 
SPEAKER2 1:49:09
Yes, I think that Catholics are real. 
SPEAKER6 1:49:13
I think the- I don't know that. I don't, like, yeah, some of my 
SPEAKER5 1:49:19
best friends claim that they're nuns, 
SPEAKER6 1:49:21
but are they? Really? 
SPEAKER2 1:49:23
Are we sure? 
SPEAKER4 1:49:25
Well, okay. 
SPEAKER1 1:49:27
I'm best friends 
SPEAKER5 1:49:29
with two nuns. And they're actually nuns. And they're lovely people. 
SPEAKER6 1:49:33
I also am friends 
SPEAKER5 1:49:35
with a monk who skateboards. Well, he did when I knew him in person. They moved him, and he might not- he didn't- he might have given the skateboard away, 
SPEAKER6 1:49:43
because he's not allowed to own it. 
SPEAKER3 1:49:45
Skateboard is pretty fucking dope, though. Skateboarding monks. 
SPEAKER5 1:49:47
Badass. He was- he taught classes, and he'd skateboard to classes. 
SPEAKER6 1:49:51
It was- it was cool. 
SPEAKER2 1:49:53
Neat. Are you on the internet yet? 
SPEAKER6 1:49:57
Mmm, maybe? 
SPEAKER2 1:49:59
Janune has died. 
SPEAKER4 1:50:01
I have a pulmonary asthma. She's in the chat. 
SPEAKER2 1:50:05
We know she's in the chat. 
SPEAKER1 1:50:07
She's in the chat. Okay. 
SPEAKER2 1:50:13
... ... ... ... ... ... ... 
SPEAKER5 1:50:27
Can I send a message with the earring to Michi and just ask, 
SPEAKER4 1:50:31
um, Ooh, okay. 
SPEAKER5 1:50:35
I'll just ask, is everything 
SPEAKER4 1:50:37
alright in there? 
SPEAKER1 1:50:39
... 
SPEAKER4 1:50:41
Michi's gonna do like a slight, kind of like, Tenzin fist, 
SPEAKER6 1:50:45
but just kind of crossing her fingers 
SPEAKER4 1:50:47
over her pinky. Yes, everything's good. Come on. 
SPEAKER6 1:50:51
You want me in? 
SPEAKER1 1:50:53
... 
SPEAKER4 1:50:55
Yeah, I think people are nice. 
SPEAKER6 1:50:57
... 
SPEAKER4 1:50:59
... 
SPEAKER5 1:51:01
I really don't like this. Um, I am going to 
SPEAKER6 1:51:05
... walk up to the door 
SPEAKER5 1:51:07
of the police office. 
SPEAKER4 1:51:09
Wait. 
SPEAKER2 1:51:11
... ... 
SPEAKER4 1:51:15
... 
SPEAKER1 1:51:17
... 
SPEAKER2 1:51:19
... ... 
SPEAKER4 1:51:23
... 
SPEAKER2 1:51:25
... 
SPEAKER6 1:51:27
... 
SPEAKER5 1:51:29
... 
SPEAKER6 1:51:31
... 
SPEAKER2 1:51:33
... ... ... ... ... ... ... 
SPEAKER5 1:51:47
I'm gonna go inside. 
SPEAKER1 1:51:49
... ... 
SPEAKER2 1:51:53
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 
SPEAKER1 1:52:23
... 
SPEAKER4 1:52:25
... 
SPEAKER5 1:52:27
... 
SPEAKER2 1:52:29
... ... 
SPEAKER5 1:52:33
is anybody else in this hallway room with me 
SPEAKER2 1:52:37
i'd say in the color that connects up this there are about five to 30 individuals um 
SPEAKER6 1:53:11
okay um 
SPEAKER5 1:53:15
i'm 
SPEAKER6 1:53:15
gonna surreptitiously like not necessarily reach for my knives but just make sure that they're like easily accessible if needed just sort of like you take like 
SPEAKER5 1:53:33
take like a like a half step and then like a slightly longer step just so i can like 
SPEAKER6 1:53:38
shuffle my cloak so that they're easy to access um and then i'm gonna start 
SPEAKER5 1:53:45
looking in the rooms off the hallway 
SPEAKER6 1:53:53
does it have a window on it or bars i'm gonna open it i'm gonna open the door 
SPEAKER2 1:54:04
well it's the moment that uh uh uh uh uh uh i'm going to um oh hey 
SPEAKER4 1:54:33
oh 
SPEAKER5 1:54:35
there you are i see you have the rest of my 
SPEAKER6 1:54:39
party 
SPEAKER2 1:54:41
i 
SPEAKER1 1:54:43
see you have the rest of my party 
SPEAKER4 1:54:45
We were on a contract, yes. 
SPEAKER5 1:54:50
Is there some trouble here? 
SPEAKER1 1:54:52
No. 
SPEAKER4 1:54:52
I assume you are familiar with the Shroud of Mark, the project you're all working on? 
SPEAKER5 1:55:09
Yes. 
SPEAKER6 1:55:10
You are familiar then with the creatures that we are running into? 
SPEAKER2 1:55:16
Yes. 
SPEAKER5 1:55:18
And I see you have preemptively placed the entire city on a curfew lockdown. 
SPEAKER6 1:55:24
That is good. 
SPEAKER3 1:55:25
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:26
I have a high score. I am in 6th. I don't know the story, but I am in 6th. I am in 6th. 
SPEAKER1 1:55:30
I am in 6th. I am in 6th. 
SPEAKER2 1:55:32
I am in 6th. I am in 6th. I am in 6th. I am in 6th. 
SPEAKER1 1:55:36
I am in 6th. I am in 6th. I am in 6th. I am in 6th. I am in 6th. 
SPEAKER5 1:55:42
Are the watches doubled as well, so that we can monitor if any of these creatures are 
SPEAKER4 1:55:47
planning on invading here? 
SPEAKER2 1:55:49
The watches have all been increased as well, by the multiple curfews of October. There is a version of the importance to get them to a level of about, but essentially all the curfews are based in the reports of New York, and are systematic, through and and searching all the caverns as one of the oldest, which is fantastic. All of the scenes that you're leading are interesting. 
SPEAKER6 1:56:16
And are you perhaps rooting out some of the elements of the criminal underground? 
SPEAKER5 1:56:24
I believe that they were the ones we were messing with earlier. 
SPEAKER2 1:56:29
So I'll add you. 
SPEAKER4 1:56:34
Perhaps. Although, once again, we're more than happy to hear any details that you might have regarding this entire situation. 
SPEAKER1 1:56:44
Well, I don't have any details as such. 
SPEAKER6 1:56:49
But I did manage to hear about some... 
SPEAKER5 1:56:56
There was some group, I think, that... That was slightly involved, or at least there was a suspicion they were involved with the missing children. 
SPEAKER6 1:57:06
Have you heard of... 
SPEAKER5 1:57:08
The name escapes me. I think it was Sister something. Maybe Sister something was the leader. 
SPEAKER2 1:57:17
27. 
SPEAKER6 1:57:23
27. 
SPEAKER4 1:57:29
I love this. I love this part of the game. When the stories don't match up. Wait, why don't the stories match up? 
SPEAKER3 1:57:45
None of the rest of the party mentioned it. Any of you about criminal groups? 
SPEAKER6 1:57:49
Okay, I'm still allowed to mention the criminal groups. 
SPEAKER3 1:57:53
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER1 1:57:54
He's like, that's... 
SPEAKER4 1:57:57
That's... A bit of a newer dimension to this. 
SPEAKER6 1:58:03
There was something... 
SPEAKER5 1:58:06
When we were wandering around trying to find them initially in the city, we ran into some unsavory elements. Barring the ones that tried to kill us. They, of course, didn't speak. They just sort of... 
SPEAKER1 1:58:22
Lunged. 
SPEAKER4 1:58:24
But, yes. 
SPEAKER2 1:58:26
Okay. Okay. Okay. We'll have to give your comment to... We'll just get into the... The question. So, it's fascinating. What other... You mentioned... I would like to see if you think they... They... What other connections do you have? 
SPEAKER6 1:58:59
Connection? Me? To a criminal syndicate? 
SPEAKER4 1:59:02
Of course. 
SPEAKER2 1:59:05
I apologize. You are from the Empire? 
SPEAKER6 1:59:11
I am from a lot of places. I don't strictly have... 
SPEAKER3 1:59:16
I apologize. My... 
SPEAKER2 1:59:17
You don't speak your language. 
SPEAKER4 1:59:20
But, what I mean here is my connection. 
SPEAKER2 1:59:23
I don't know yet. Did you have thought that you had brought up that they were involved? I'd like to know a little more about that. 
SPEAKER4 1:59:33
I cannot... 
SPEAKER5 1:59:37
I am not from here. I only arrived with a small group. And we were trying to do some good. So, I cannot say much for how things are involved here. 
SPEAKER6 1:59:48
But, there was... 
SPEAKER4 1:59:51
Certain... 
SPEAKER6 1:59:53
Inconsistencies... That did not match up. 
SPEAKER5 1:59:57
And there were... 
SPEAKER6 1:59:59
There were markings... 
SPEAKER4 2:00:01
Um... I... 
SPEAKER6 2:00:05
I cannot... 
SPEAKER5 2:00:06
I cannot remember exactly what it was. I think it was sister something. 
SPEAKER6 2:00:10
I don't remember. 
SPEAKER5 2:00:12
I don't know where to find them or how to go about determining if they were involved. 
SPEAKER6 2:00:19
I don't know. 
SPEAKER5 2:00:21
I really should be more careful about what I lie about, shouldn't I? Twenty-two. 
SPEAKER3 2:00:30
But... 
SPEAKER6 2:00:31
I don't know anything, officer! 
SPEAKER5 2:00:35
There was suspicious when the children were taken. 
SPEAKER6 2:00:39
It... 
SPEAKER5 2:00:40
No one knew anything about it. 
SPEAKER4 2:00:42
And... 
SPEAKER5 2:00:44
We were questioning people and stories did not add up. 
SPEAKER4 2:00:48
I... 
SPEAKER2 2:00:50
I see. 
SPEAKER3 2:00:51
Do you remember who you might have questioned? 
SPEAKER2 2:00:53
As part of this? 
SPEAKER4 2:00:54
I was not... 
SPEAKER6 2:00:57
Involved in most of it. 
SPEAKER3 2:00:59
I do not... 
SPEAKER5 2:01:00
Convey myself exactly... 
SPEAKER6 2:01:02
As one of this town. 
SPEAKER5 2:01:04
It's easy to tell as I am not from here. But... It was just people around. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:09
We questioned Charlotte, of course, because we wanted to know more. 
SPEAKER5 2:01:12
And... People who were involved in the crime. And... People who we thought might have seen something. Um... Innkeepers... 
SPEAKER6 2:01:21
Uh... 
SPEAKER5 2:01:22
People we sought for her neighbors. Uh... It's... 
SPEAKER6 2:01:26
Everybody. 
SPEAKER5 2:01:27
Pretty much anybody we can get a question to. 
SPEAKER4 2:01:28
Exactly. 
SPEAKER3 2:01:29
So... 
SPEAKER4 2:01:30
Our involvement with criminal enterprises is not really a thing. It's mainly just us asking questions, as adventurers do. 
SPEAKER3 2:01:35
I see. I see. I see. I see. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:39
I see. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:40
I see. I see. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:42
I see. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:43
I see. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:44
I see. I see. I see. 
SPEAKER1 2:01:47
I see. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:48
I see. 
SPEAKER3 2:01:49
I see. 
SPEAKER6 2:01:50
I see. 
SPEAKER3 2:01:51
My pleasure. 
SPEAKER2 2:01:52
Thanks a bunch, though. Nope, no problem, towards the end. Yep. Is Jinut still wearing the fucking skull of the dudes? You can all see Jinut as you've all stepped out now. 
SPEAKER3 2:01:58

SPEAKER2 2:02:00

Correct. So as a soldier, you use your two arms to, what, you use a gun, you use a sword. 
SPEAKER6 2:07:02
So what would happen if you lost both your arms? What would you do then? 
SPEAKER4 2:07:20
Hmm. See, that's not, that's just not in the books for me. 
SPEAKER6 2:07:28
Us tabaxis don't do retirement. 
SPEAKER4 2:07:30
To Nunes, clearly, clearly, just one more thing and he's ready to snap. 
SPEAKER2 2:07:42
Perhaps, perhaps he'll be able to do that. 
SPEAKER6 2:07:49
What? No. What do you mean? I'm having so much fun. 
SPEAKER4 2:07:56
Right. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:00
Or I'm so scared. I can tell you. 
SPEAKER3 2:08:08
I can tell you. 
SPEAKER2 2:08:13
I would go get him. 
SPEAKER6 2:08:15
Before the guy goes, Janoon is going to reach into his bag of holding with his one hand that he still has. He's going to pull out the rope or sushi. He goes, would you like some rope or sushi? 
SPEAKER2 2:08:33
I guess it would probably end with no, no, just a gas. I think I am well enough home. 
SPEAKER4 2:08:42
Hmm. More for me then. Michi is going to- 
SPEAKER5 2:08:47
He's going to eat a piece. 
SPEAKER4 2:08:49
It's just a down the hatch constitution. Michi's going to look at Janoon and, huh. To think. A lowly roper would take you down. Huh. Woulda think there would have been like, other things that would kill you. 
SPEAKER6 2:09:07
Well when you already beaten up and you're alone. 
SPEAKER4 2:09:15
Who would have thunk it, right? 
SPEAKER3 2:09:19
Yeah well sometimes you make split decisions muj refrain de excuser en segmes affiorar. 
SPEAKER6 2:09:20
Well, — — snack. 
SPEAKER4 2:09:22
Mr. mannequin You say remember him finally. Your little friend, Mr. mannequin. Jessica, why you give me that kind of a hodriven up the ass Colombia? You know that's probably the hard annoying part about this argument. The quarantine fraud as a matter of fact. 
SPEAKER6 2:09:28
That's a 15. It is 
SPEAKER2 2:09:32
foul. Foul in every way. It is the most bitter thing you've ever tasted. And as soon as you're done chewing it, 
SPEAKER4 2:09:41
there's this bite into it. 
SPEAKER3 2:09:44
And it's kind of like a chicken. And you're expecting this stone exterior to be a bit crunchy. Bite into it, get halfway through, 
SPEAKER2 2:09:52
and there's another sick crunch. Like some sort of bone 
SPEAKER4 2:09:55
or insect-like 
SPEAKER2 2:09:57
carcass that's underneath it. And it immediately comes 
SPEAKER4 2:10:01
not only the most bitter thing 
SPEAKER2 2:10:03
you've ever tasted, but there's a huge that begins to build in your mouth. It's just intolerable. 
SPEAKER4 2:10:11
Alright, 
SPEAKER5 2:10:11
what do I have to roll to 
SPEAKER6 2:10:12
make it 
SPEAKER3 2:10:15
seem like I don't react? 
SPEAKER4 2:10:19
Roll a 
SPEAKER6 2:10:20
deception check. 
SPEAKER3 2:10:21
I'm kidding. I want to roll 
SPEAKER4 2:10:25
into this one. Can I? 
SPEAKER2 2:10:27
Roll insight. 
SPEAKER4 2:10:30
Oh, I was gonna let her say if I could. 
SPEAKER5 2:10:37
It's okay. I'm not winning this one. 
SPEAKER3 2:10:39
Yeah, um, 
SPEAKER1 2:10:41
you see, all of you, 
SPEAKER2 2:10:43
and to Tantar, all of you watch Jin whip out this piece of rope and just take 
SPEAKER3 2:10:49
a bite out of it. 
SPEAKER2 2:10:51
And then immediately try and like grin through it before the chewing stops. 
SPEAKER6 2:10:57
And there's 
SPEAKER2 2:10:59
this look of disgust 
SPEAKER1 2:11:01
which then turns into an immediate blushing that goes 
SPEAKER2 2:11:05
across their entire face 
SPEAKER1 2:11:06
as little beads of sweat fall on their brow. 
SPEAKER6 2:11:13
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:11:14
That's what I was just about to say. I don't know if these are safe to eat. 
SPEAKER5 2:11:18
That's why I brought it back. I don't know what you speak of. This is my favorite afternoon snack. 
SPEAKER6 2:11:27
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:11:30
I'm saying between coughs because the heat keeps getting worse. 
SPEAKER3 2:11:36
Delicious 
SPEAKER6 2:11:36
and nutritious. 
SPEAKER5 2:11:41
Can I grab a piece of roper and like a fairly sizable chunk, cut it off, and just like look at it, intrigued. 
SPEAKER2 2:11:50
You look at this weird 
SPEAKER1 2:11:52
semi-translucent flesh that I want to get hold of 
SPEAKER6 2:11:58
and yell at people who are sitting right in front of me 
SPEAKER1 2:12:00
and act like they're holding a box and just actively rotting into the bag. Right. 
SPEAKER5 2:12:06
I'm going to cut another chunk and immediately stick it in the bag. 
SPEAKER3 2:12:10
It's still rotting 
SPEAKER5 2:12:11
with your leg. Into the bag. 
SPEAKER1 2:12:13
You have a small piece of roper. 
SPEAKER5 2:12:16
No, no. I want a hunk of roper. I don't want a small piece. I want a sizable chunk. Just noting that it's got to be the one that Mishi pulled out from earlier 
SPEAKER6 2:12:26
because it's a little bit more 
SPEAKER5 2:12:26
because the one I ate is roper sushi that I got from the cave by myself. I don't care. I would like a piece of roper. If it has that on people, I have many uses. I didn't know if Mishi still had it out or not. 
SPEAKER3 2:12:42
Oh yeah, it's still on the ground. I'm not fucking picking my shit back up. I'm going to double check it for loot. 
SPEAKER6 2:12:50
I'm going to kick it. 
SPEAKER3 2:12:52
I'm going to kick it. You're going to kick it? Like a fucking piñata. 
SPEAKER1 2:12:56
Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 2:12:56
Give me the loot. 
SPEAKER3 2:12:59
I know there's still something there. Hold on one, guys. Okay. Anyway. 
SPEAKER2 2:13:08
The Tenet Tarn essentially says you're free to stand across this until I get word back. But we'll have to do it until then. 
SPEAKER3 2:13:17
Once I have word back from my commander, 
SPEAKER2 2:13:20
we should be able to work out something that allows you to continue your business in the city, I think. Later. If we need more information. 
SPEAKER3 2:13:29
Hopefully it doesn't take too long. 
SPEAKER2 2:13:32
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 2:13:34
In the meantime, 
SPEAKER2 2:13:38
if we were to give an update 
SPEAKER1 2:13:40
to this font, what would you as a group like to communicate? 
SPEAKER3 2:13:46
And also, 
SPEAKER2 2:13:47
most parties here have a group name. Have you decided on one? Is there one that you wish to go by? 
SPEAKER1 2:13:56
Yes. 
SPEAKER3 2:13:57
What did we say last night, Koi? Um. Oh my god, I'm trying to remember. It was something dumb, but it was funny. Fuck. It was... Oh wait, Brain Rot? It was something like Brain Rot, I thought. 
SPEAKER5 2:14:15
It would be Brain Rot. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:22
And it fits the theme of brains. Brains? 
SPEAKER6 2:14:25
Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:26
Right? 
SPEAKER6 2:14:28
An official first quest for us. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:30
We're the Brains. But we have rot. We're the Brain Rots. 
SPEAKER1 2:14:33
I'm joking, I don't know. 
SPEAKER2 2:14:35
Okay, we'll shelve that matter for now. Um. 
SPEAKER1 2:14:38
It shouldn't be written. 
SPEAKER2 2:14:40
I will have to attend to some other matters. Um. But we would like to... 
SPEAKER3 2:14:45
We would like to wait in the room 
SPEAKER1 2:14:46
back to work. I will come get you post-haste. 
SPEAKER3 2:14:51
Okay. Um. Would you be able to send an order for 
SPEAKER6 2:14:54
maybe some... 
SPEAKER3 2:14:56
potions so we can heal up a little bit more? Just in case anything happens? Um. It... 
SPEAKER1 2:15:03
It depends. 
SPEAKER3 2:15:04
Do you have a... 
SPEAKER6 2:15:05
a set of copper-crimson pliers? 
SPEAKER2 2:15:07
Let's see. 
SPEAKER3 2:15:10
I should. I... I believe. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:15:15
Uh, if you... 
SPEAKER6 2:15:16
If you have your gold partitioned, 
SPEAKER2 2:15:18
I can try and send a runner 
SPEAKER6 2:15:19
to make a list of what other... skills they can find. Hmm. I don't know what preciousness... 
SPEAKER3 2:15:25
are. 
SPEAKER6 2:15:26
Mm. 
SPEAKER3 2:15:26
I... 
SPEAKER6 2:15:27
I'm gonna have to do that in person then. 
SPEAKER3 2:15:29
I also don't trust people with my money. No offense. 
SPEAKER6 2:15:32
Now you can take it. 
SPEAKER3 2:15:36
Anyways. Oh. Bonnie? 
SPEAKER1 2:15:41
You go back to the... the... 
SPEAKER6 2:15:44
the... 
SPEAKER1 2:15:44
room, basically. 
SPEAKER3 2:15:47
Is there anything that anyone here would like to do? 
SPEAKER2 2:15:49
Is that... It's gonna be about twenty minutes before someone comes back and gets... 
SPEAKER3 2:15:53
engaged. 
SPEAKER2 2:15:54
Is there anything anyone here wants to do? Any stories y'all wanna crowdwrite on? 
SPEAKER1 2:15:57
What's... 
SPEAKER6 2:15:58
Where's he song honed by now? 
SPEAKER3 2:16:00
Cause they're probably not still dumping water on him. 
SPEAKER2 2:16:03
By now you have been given a rough drive, and... It's basically at the time when they're leading the rest of the party out of the room, you're being led back to the... 
SPEAKER6 2:16:12
uh... 
SPEAKER2 2:16:13
the bandage of much of the... scars that he... 
SPEAKER6 2:16:16
wounds that you've already had. Okay. Wait, I just... 
SPEAKER3 2:16:20
I'm talking about the visage of Chimney, 
SPEAKER2 2:16:22
looking like they just... 
SPEAKER6 2:16:23
uh... 
SPEAKER2 2:16:24
uh... 
SPEAKER3 2:16:25
I'll put ninety thousand... 
SPEAKER6 2:16:26
Excuse me? 
SPEAKER3 2:16:27
a barrel of fucking... 
SPEAKER2 2:16:29
California Hebrews. 
SPEAKER6 2:16:32
Scarf. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:16:34
Why did you have to use that visualization? 
SPEAKER2 2:16:38
Because, more to be part of a monster. 
SPEAKER5 2:16:41
Um... Again, why do you have to... Once again, why do you have to say it like that? 
SPEAKER6 2:16:47
You're welcome. 
SPEAKER3 2:16:50
That's coy. 
SPEAKER5 2:16:51
That's not all Iyana. 
SPEAKER6 2:16:52
Hey! 
SPEAKER4 2:16:53
Am I wrong? 
SPEAKER3 2:16:55
Fair. 
SPEAKER1 2:16:56
I... 
SPEAKER3 2:16:57
don't have... great... I have pain tolerance, but not spice tolerance. 
SPEAKER1 2:17:01
That's not the point of talking about... 
SPEAKER3 2:17:02
Give sub-tolerance, is what you get. 
SPEAKER5 2:17:04
We're talking about the monster part, not the... not the spice. I would like to corroborate stories. 
SPEAKER3 2:17:08
I'm not a monster fucker. 
SPEAKER1 2:17:09
Yes you are! 
SPEAKER2 2:17:10
You just literally admitted to it! 
SPEAKER5 2:17:12
Why not? I don't remember this. 
SPEAKER3 2:17:14
Okay! 
SPEAKER5 2:17:15
So, Forza wants to corroborate... I would like to corroborate stories! 
SPEAKER3 2:17:17
Did he... 
SPEAKER1 2:17:18
One can't even still have his clothes on, or did they take it off? I don't remember this. 
SPEAKER5 2:17:20
Okay, so Forza wants to corroborate... 
SPEAKER3 2:17:21
I would like to corroborate stories. He doesn't even have his clothes on, or did they take it off? 
SPEAKER1 2:17:23
I just don't remember this. I have a question. 
SPEAKER3 2:17:25
That's a good question. Would you have let them take your clothes off? 
SPEAKER1 2:17:27
Would you have taken your clothes off? 
SPEAKER6 2:17:28
Someone... 
SPEAKER3 2:17:29
Someone quote that. 
SPEAKER5 2:17:30
Someone quote both of those, please. I think he just kind of... 
SPEAKER6 2:17:32
stand there and let the... 
SPEAKER1 2:17:33
like... 
SPEAKER3 2:17:34
he wouldn't care, yeah, I guess he just... 
SPEAKER1 2:17:35
if they don't... 
SPEAKER5 2:17:36
Well, they're not going to question you, so... 
SPEAKER1 2:17:37
Congratulations. 
SPEAKER5 2:17:38
You're still fully clothed. 
SPEAKER1 2:17:39
You're just so... Oh. Oh, but his clothes are just... That's awful. He's not going to... 
SPEAKER3 2:17:44
Oh, yeah. 
SPEAKER1 2:17:45
He's not going to... Oh, yeah. 
SPEAKER6 2:17:47
He's not going to... Oh, yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:17:52
He's not going to... 
SPEAKER2 2:17:53
Well, he's like a bird. 
SPEAKER3 2:17:56
I imagine Kenku don't really have anything visible, because they're feathery? So he's just... If he's... 
SPEAKER2 2:18:02
It's between you and your hair, Kenku. 
SPEAKER5 2:18:05
Alright, well, he's still modest enough, so he's just going to pull off the, like, wet 
SPEAKER6 2:18:11
ass, just soaking wet clothes, because that's awful. 
SPEAKER3 2:18:15
And then he's just going to kind of stand there, like, clueless, like, okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:18:21
Okay. And then he's quickly constantly going to accomplish this. 
SPEAKER2 2:18:24
Yeah, exactly. 
SPEAKER1 2:18:25
So Kenku's going to stay on top of Rey's tailored entrails, so he's willing to place him. He's willing to stand, just that... Because yeah, even if that's not going to work on yourly, well, you need a little reach. And then you're going to let that stay there until you clarify what it says about the lower body. Well, and then... I mean, I mean, it's not going to last so long. That's follow up. Don't worry, okay. 
SPEAKER3 2:18:41
Kendku will be Okay, now... Okay, and then he's like, okay, once I close... 
SPEAKER1 2:18:43
Wait, what happened? 
SPEAKER3 2:18:44
What? 
SPEAKER1 2:18:45
He's like, I need to wear my quoi ya. 
SPEAKER3 2:18:46
So now he's... Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:18:48
Okay. He's like, okay. I don't know, something's happening. I don't know, you haven't been given any pain meds yet. Ouch. Oh yeah. 
SPEAKER5 2:18:59
Real womp womp moments there, Chief. 
SPEAKER3 2:19:01
I'll say, okay, he's cooperating, but his movements are pretty slow. Painful. Kind of like when it's like, you've done like a hard leg day and then it's the next day and you're just like 
SPEAKER1 2:19:14
Oh my god. 
SPEAKER5 2:19:15
So sore like all over. Going up the stairs after leg day. Those kind of slow movements, a little shaky, unsteady, um, and 
SPEAKER1 2:19:25
I don't know if I like it. Yeah, and then, um 
SPEAKER5 2:19:29
I've never had issues with that. 
SPEAKER1 2:19:31
And he'll kind of occasionally, like, kind of try to 
SPEAKER6 2:19:37
kind of like just occasionally let out like a small groan in pain as they're dressing him. And he just wants it over with sooner. 
SPEAKER4 2:19:49
I'm just watching the bird hobble around, being pathetic as shit. Yeah, he's also like, naked too. So kind of like, like there's nothing visible, he's just feathery. Hm. Well, we'll get you some clothes once we're done here. Don't worry. 
SPEAKER6 2:20:10
I guess now they'd probably also realize how thin his frame is. 
SPEAKER4 2:20:14
Because he's definitely kind of like a runt. He looks like a stick with feathers glued on it. Not gonna lie. 
SPEAKER2 2:20:23
Huh. Alright. 
SPEAKER4 2:20:28
Not sure what to do with that. 
SPEAKER2 2:20:34
Anyway. Uh, so, Forest, you're trying to corroborate some stories. What are you doing here? 
SPEAKER6 2:20:41
Um, I, mostly I feel like 
SPEAKER5 2:20:44
it's safe to assume that Michi has been the one doing most of the talking. Given that, uh, Isang-hun and Jun-yoon were not in the room. Um, so I'm basically just gonna be looking at everybody and being like, So, I am right in assuming that our goal is to get the guards to help us deal with this matter and to find the children. Um, hopefully to eliminate the sister person, group, whatever they are. Um, and hopefully deal a little more with the children. A little more with that side, if it is not just the monsters. If there's a person in the city behind it. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:22
Um, is that our goal right now? 
SPEAKER5 2:21:25
Just to be on the same page? 
SPEAKER1 2:21:27
After coming out of all of, of, all of it? 
SPEAKER5 2:21:31
All of that? Everything that just happened? 
SPEAKER6 2:21:36
I'm gonna look at others. Well. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:41
Are you guys still in the room watching me, hun? You could be. 
SPEAKER2 2:21:48
Where, where is everyone? You guys have just gone back to the previous room? 
SPEAKER1 2:21:51
Or are you in the room with... 
SPEAKER6 2:21:54
Everyone else? Well, the dude left us, so we're all by ourselves. 
SPEAKER1 2:21:58
What I took from that. Yeah, so, no. Jun-yoon and Isang-hun, you guys are on your own. 
SPEAKER6 2:22:03
Okay. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:04
Oh, okay, I don't know. Um. 
SPEAKER6 2:22:10
Well. Should we gather people, or should we discuss this in full? Cause just the three, four of us would be really... 
SPEAKER1 2:22:20
Probably not most ideal. 
SPEAKER6 2:22:22
Yeah. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:23
Uh, if they will let us leave, I suppose? I thought they had more, uh, need of us later. 
SPEAKER5 2:22:31
He said within the premises. 
SPEAKER1 2:22:33
So let's go find the others. Shall we? 
SPEAKER5 2:22:36
We're gonna ask our, we're friends outside the room. 
SPEAKER3 2:22:40
You're going to meet today or right outside the room? 
SPEAKER1 2:22:42
I don't know. 
SPEAKER3 2:22:43
I don't know. I don't know. We're gonna meet here right outside the door. Oh. 
SPEAKER5 2:22:48
Yeah, well, get in here. Yeah, but you guys are literally just without me. 
SPEAKER3 2:22:51
Yeah, no, this is one building. Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:22:54
A small part of this building has been separated off to create a room. The rest of this building is an open space that is half infirmary, half in-camp center. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:01
The man, the lieutenant did not leave, by the way. 
SPEAKER2 2:23:04
He's just in the other half, going over the charts with all the rest of the Don's Guard and Iron Maverick. 
SPEAKER6 2:23:10
Mm. 
SPEAKER4 2:23:12
Anyway. 
SPEAKER1 2:23:13
That makes sense now. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:15
And so we are in the little room on the side? 
SPEAKER1 2:23:20
Yes. Okay. Well. Yes. 
SPEAKER3 2:23:27
Maybe we should come up with a plan while we're on our own a little bit. 
SPEAKER1 2:23:31
Yes. 
SPEAKER5 2:23:34
Is the goal, as I laid out, is that, that is what we are trying to do still, right? No one has any second thoughts about this? 
SPEAKER6 2:23:43
Could you re-alliterate that for the two that were just outside the door? 
SPEAKER3 2:23:48
Ah. 
SPEAKER5 2:23:49
Um. We are trying to get help, uh, to, to get rid of the, the creatures, if we can. Uh, we are trying to potentially get rid of the sister person group, whatever, that seems suspicious when we're asking people questions. Uh, we are trying to find the missing children and solve the disappearances. Uh. Not necessarily in that order, but trying to accomplish each of those three goals. You know, that doesn't sound like a bad idea. Except for one easy, meaty, tiny problem I see getting in the way. 
SPEAKER1 2:24:24
Mm? 
SPEAKER5 2:24:26
I'm missing my fucking arm and leg! 
SPEAKER1 2:24:31
Uh. 
SPEAKER5 2:24:34
Are you? I suppose on that front, we should try to enlist the help of a healer. Mm. So that we don't separate from the group again. To prevent this happening again. 
SPEAKER3 2:24:45
We're... 
SPEAKER1 2:24:46
Mm. 
SPEAKER3 2:24:47
We're not going back to the same healer you took us to last time you needed help. 
SPEAKER5 2:24:53
For one... 
SPEAKER3 2:24:55
We're going to a real healer this time. Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 2:24:58
And for one, we all agreed to go. So I'm not sure why I went, I continued forth after everyone agreed to continue forth. And no one seemed to follow behind. 
SPEAKER1 2:25:12
I did call you back, though. No, you didn't. We had a save. You did. 
SPEAKER3 2:25:17
Yeah, I did. 
SPEAKER1 2:25:18
Out of character, meaty did call out. I... Out of character, I do not remember that. 
SPEAKER3 2:25:23
I genuinely do not. 
SPEAKER5 2:25:24
It did happen because it was... The yelling was happening, and then the people... 
SPEAKER1 2:25:26
I think it was you and Gizzard and Ord who were in the tunnels, and you heard, and you 
SPEAKER5 2:25:27
didn't wanna, like... No, no. Yeah. It's a different... 
SPEAKER6 2:25:31
We're up to a different thing. 
SPEAKER5 2:25:32
Yeah. I think it was you and Gizzard and Ord who were in the tunnels, and you heard, and you didn't wanna, like... 
SPEAKER1 2:25:35
No, no. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:25:37
It's a different... 
SPEAKER2 2:25:38
It's a different reference to a different thing. This is basically, Junoon, you had already gone down. 
SPEAKER3 2:25:44
Uh... 
SPEAKER2 2:25:45
Meechy did call down to you to basically say that they had to go back and save Ord. 
SPEAKER1 2:25:50
Um... 
SPEAKER3 2:25:51
So, that did happen. 
SPEAKER6 2:25:52
Out of character. But Junoon didn't hear it. 
SPEAKER5 2:25:54
I... Is that what I'm understanding? I don't know if Junoon just didn't hear it, or... 
SPEAKER3 2:25:57
Okay. 
SPEAKER2 2:25:58
I can go back to the transcripts, but there was at least a call out. 
SPEAKER1 2:25:59
Okay. So, Junoon, you had already gone down. 
SPEAKER3 2:26:01
I... 
SPEAKER2 2:26:02
Junoon, you had already gone down. 
SPEAKER3 2:26:03
I... 
SPEAKER1 2:26:04
Junoon, you had already gone down. I... Junoon, you had already gone down. Okay. I don't care. Yeah. Feel free to roll quickly. 
SPEAKER6 2:26:11
We're standing. 
SPEAKER3 2:26:12
Absolutely. 
SPEAKER1 2:26:13
I think we should do that. Well, I did call out to you. 
SPEAKER5 2:26:15
We would just have to be much more careful about regrouping and ensuring they're all together before we go on. 
SPEAKER1 2:26:29
Yes. Yes, we've... 
SPEAKER3 2:26:37
We will need to stay as a group if we want to make any progress, and if the last cave is anything to go by, then we're probably going to need some help from the guards or 
SPEAKER6 2:26:50
someone else if we want to keep going. 
SPEAKER1 2:26:53
I think getting that done sooner than later would be the best idea. 
SPEAKER5 2:26:57
Is it? Are we... Are we going towards trying to wipe out the creatures down there, or do we want to look around town more and see if we can figure out the issues here? 
SPEAKER6 2:27:11
No. 
SPEAKER1 2:27:12
I think considering our current operation, if we do try to find things in town, we're going to waste too much precious time. Considering that these things can disguise themselves. Uh, we don't know if that... Those people or that person is potentially infected already, so if we systematically go at this... 
SPEAKER6 2:27:35
It'd be better to just wipe it out from the source, and then continue on if you know. Then how do you suggest that I, for lack of a better term, mope around with you in this 
SPEAKER3 2:27:52
condition? 
SPEAKER6 2:27:53
Have you trained fusion? 
SPEAKER1 2:27:56
Junoon just looks both done and confused. Uh, for now, I think potentially we could work something out. 
SPEAKER5 2:28:15
Uh, litter maybe? Or just... 
SPEAKER6 2:28:18
Uh, you could... 
SPEAKER5 2:28:20
How tall are you, actually? 
SPEAKER1 2:28:22
Junoon is... Pretty sure I had him like 5'6", but let me double check. 
SPEAKER3 2:28:31
Okay, and who's the... 
SPEAKER5 2:28:33
Who's the... Who's the tallest person in our party? Is it... It's Gizzard, right? 
SPEAKER6 2:28:38
Because he's... 
SPEAKER5 2:28:39
Large? 
SPEAKER1 2:28:40
Yeah, I think Gizzard's the tallest. 
SPEAKER6 2:28:41
That's nice, Ord. 
SPEAKER3 2:28:42
Because Ord is... 
SPEAKER5 2:28:43
I think Ord is the strongest, but I think Ord's a gnome, and I think Gizzard is like 
SPEAKER1 2:28:48
the tallest? Yeah, Gizzard's not as tall. Because we have a tall... 
SPEAKER3 2:28:51
I was joking. I was right, I did remember his height. 
SPEAKER5 2:28:53
He's 5'6". Um, perhaps, Gizzard, you might lend assistance in some way? I don't know. I don't know. 
SPEAKER6 2:28:57
I don't know. I don't know. 
SPEAKER5 2:28:59
I don't know. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:00
I don't know. 
SPEAKER5 2:29:01
I don't know. I don't know. You could lend assistance, since the rest of us are kind of unsuited to, uh... 
SPEAKER1 2:29:05
Helping with the carrying? You could tie the cat to your back. And when we run into more monsters, you expect me, a monk, who gets up close and personal, 
SPEAKER5 2:29:25
to, you know, do my thing. I mean, your other option is we find you a lovely inn in town? I guess. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:31
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 2:29:32
and you stay and recuperate until we have taken care of the problem and have the funds to procure regrowth services. I'm assuming magic can do that. 
SPEAKER1 2:29:45
Maybe. 
SPEAKER5 2:29:47
I'm going to look at Jizzer and be like, can it? You know magic, right? Can you fix arms that are missing? 
SPEAKER1 2:29:53
I don't know magic that well. 
SPEAKER5 2:29:55
I am no lizard. I do not regrow things. But no, but magic, it can fix things. So presumably if we have the funds, we can get some sort of magic man to magic you back to a normal, pre-digested state. I don't think that's how that works. Does magic not have the ability to magic? If the scroll were to bring me back, and it did not bring back my leg and my arm, 
SPEAKER6 2:30:27
I don't think it will come back. 
SPEAKER1 2:30:30
I mean... 
SPEAKER5 2:30:32
That's just my thought. The option then is to not try, and to just... I don't know. All I can think of right now is we try to bring you along, 
SPEAKER1 2:30:46
or we leave you and try to find a magic man who can magic you. 
SPEAKER5 2:30:51
I don't understand. If you're trying to help me think of something, 
SPEAKER1 2:30:55
I'm not particularly smart, 
SPEAKER5 2:30:57
and I don't understand. 
SPEAKER1 2:31:00
That's what one of the doctors in the room said. There are... 
SPEAKER3 2:31:06
I have known, if you're... 
SPEAKER1 2:31:09
Maybe he's extremely awkward. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:12
I have known there to be some tinkerers 
SPEAKER1 2:31:16
in the surrounding territories and worldwide make some sort of assimilate for you, but I'm not sure if some of your considerable apparent talents might find that useful or not. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:29
Hmm. 
SPEAKER6 2:31:29
It's almost like I was thinking the same thing. 
SPEAKER2 2:31:33
Oh, you've seen some of these individuals? 
SPEAKER3 2:31:35
Once before in battle? 
SPEAKER4 2:31:37
They... 
SPEAKER5 2:31:38
Oh, you're talking about the people who can make things. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:40
Oh, man. 
SPEAKER5 2:31:41
Yeah, I mean, yes, but I've also seen... 
SPEAKER1 2:31:43
I saw a guy on the battlefield, like, a while ago. 
SPEAKER3 2:31:47
You sparring, he had a metal arm. 
SPEAKER1 2:31:49
He started with a motherfucker. Yes. Very much. Mayhaps one was mine. Oh, you make them? Yes. No, no, no, not yet. But I can probably pick up the habit of it real quick. Real quick. Yes, I'm gonna try. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:13
I have heard of magics that can restore such thing, but... 
SPEAKER2 2:32:16
Such thing as a missing limb, but... 
SPEAKER1 2:32:18
I have here in the middle of... middle of nowhere, and it's rare in part. 
SPEAKER2 2:32:21
Not that. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:22
Um... But, uh... Yeah. I apologize. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:28
I'm a medical professional. I use it when a limb is gone. I would say it's a retirement for whoever I'm working on. I'm not interested to be upset about that. 
SPEAKER2 2:32:32
So... 
SPEAKER1 2:32:33
Ah, the cat will be fine. I'm less concerned about the cat than the bird over here. 
SPEAKER6 2:32:35
What the fuck happened to this thing? 
SPEAKER2 2:32:36
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:37
He's so... I don't know, just kind of... 
SPEAKER3 2:32:39
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER6 2:32:40
... heard of it. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:41
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:42
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER6 2:32:43
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:44
It's a bird. It's a bird. It's a bird. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:47
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:48
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:49
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:50
It's a bird. It's a bird. It's a bird. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:53
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER1 2:32:54
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER6 2:32:55
He's so... 
SPEAKER3 2:32:56
I don't know, just kind of... 
SPEAKER6 2:32:57
It's a bird. 
SPEAKER3 2:32:58
... perk up and just look kind of curiously at, um... The guy who's talking about him. 
SPEAKER1 2:33:05
Yeah, you, uh... 
SPEAKER3 2:33:08
You're... 
SPEAKER1 2:33:09
You're handling a... Handbag. 
SPEAKER3 2:33:11
What's a handbag? 
SPEAKER1 2:33:12
A handbag is a small bag carried in a hand. Hand. 
SPEAKER2 2:33:18
Bag. 
SPEAKER6 2:33:19
A handbag... 
SPEAKER5 2:33:20
Handbag. 
SPEAKER2 2:33:21
A handbag. 
SPEAKER1 2:33:22
A handbag. 
SPEAKER2 2:33:23
We love hearing sirens in Spokane. 
SPEAKER1 2:33:35
Anyways, per se. 
SPEAKER3 2:33:38
He's just kinda looking down at the ground, almost like he could ask himself the same thing. 
SPEAKER6 2:33:51
Well. 
SPEAKER1 2:33:54
Just patching up whatever opening gaps he has. There's a small pile of leather on the floor, where they had to pluck and cut away, and patch the draft properly. Yeah. 
SPEAKER3 2:34:11
Just, yeah. He doesn't really answer, he just kinda looks down. 
SPEAKER6 2:34:24
Well, doesn't look like you're gonna answer from that anytime soon. 
SPEAKER2 2:34:29
But, as minutes have passed, soon both the messenger comes back. Initially you see the special order, this additional sub-comment. 
SPEAKER3 2:34:37
They make a call. 
SPEAKER6 2:34:39
Kind of a hasty beat. 
SPEAKER2 2:34:40
Around all of you, and head up to the lieutenant, they say, they whisper something to you. 
SPEAKER1 2:34:48
At which point the lieutenant turns around and joins them in contact, and he says, 
SPEAKER2 2:34:53
Well, it looks like some things do get progressed faster than we thought. 
SPEAKER1 2:34:59
It seems that, uh... Commander of the Dawnscar, would like to speak to you. Looks like we are... Would like to get more details, but potentially packed on something sooner than even I could have perceived. 
SPEAKER6 2:35:14
Very well. Make haste. 
SPEAKER1 2:35:17
It seems they're coming here, actually. Oh. Good. And it is... Another two, three minutes before you hear, uh... 
SPEAKER2 2:35:27
Kind of a reverie played on some horn outside. 
SPEAKER1 2:35:31
And you can see through the gaps in the windows that everyone outside is snatched to a position of attention. And as you can see, the commander of the Dawnscar has another figure. This one, a full elf. 
SPEAKER2 2:35:41
Shorter than you'd think, standing at about five-a-level, and stockier than most of the other figures, walks into the building at your hand. 
SPEAKER1 2:35:48
Uh, this figure... 
SPEAKER6 2:35:50
He or she? 
SPEAKER1 2:35:51
Hm? 
SPEAKER6 2:35:52
He or she. 
SPEAKER1 2:35:53
He. Uh... 
SPEAKER3 2:35:55
Oh. Long, blonde hair put up in a bun. 
SPEAKER6 2:35:58
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 2:35:59
The armor itself is ornate. But, Michi, you'd notice, it's ornate, but it's not just ceremonial. 
SPEAKER2 2:36:04
This is functional. 
SPEAKER1 2:36:06
On his... On either hip, there are pieces for scimitars. 
SPEAKER2 2:36:10
Uh... 
SPEAKER1 2:36:11
And the armor itself has various tools of, uh... Kind of that same crystal you found earlier, blazing into a figure of a setting sun. Oh... No problem. 
SPEAKER6 2:36:24
Blazes the crystal that Michi was trying to mine off the wall? 
SPEAKER1 2:36:28
Uh, no. In fact, people who'd recognize this crystal would be, uh, actually the ones who'd recognize it. The fours would recognize this. And then, Sunghung would recognize this. Is it, like, the one from the... 
SPEAKER3 2:36:41
Roll perception shots. 
SPEAKER6 2:36:42
Ugh. 
SPEAKER1 2:36:43
Hate perception. Why do you make me do perception, Devon? 
SPEAKER5 2:36:45
Because! I love perception. 
SPEAKER3 2:36:47
Why can't you make me do something like stealth or lying? 19. 
SPEAKER5 2:36:49
Oh, 19. So low. So very low. 
SPEAKER1 2:36:52
Okay, compared to a 29, a 22, and a 27? 
SPEAKER3 2:36:53
I'm just sayin'. 
SPEAKER2 2:36:54
I'm just sayin'. 
SPEAKER3 2:36:55
Hey, guys. 
SPEAKER5 2:36:56
I'm just saying. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. 
SPEAKER1 2:36:59
I'm just saying. I'm just saying. 
SPEAKER5 2:37:01
I'm just saying. I'm just saying. 
SPEAKER3 2:37:03
I'm just saying. I'm just saying. 
SPEAKER6 2:37:05
19. 
SPEAKER1 2:37:06
19, 2. 
SPEAKER2 2:37:07
19, 2. Both of you'd recognize this as, uh, some medium crystals. There is a lot less. This is small accents that are on it. Um, not, uh, large chunks or large pieces of crystals are meant to be. 
SPEAKER3 2:37:21
They almost look decorative. 
SPEAKER2 2:37:22
You don't, you're not sure if they are, but they almost look decorative. 
SPEAKER1 2:37:27
Um, this figure plays within the colors of the Morlock House, and the whole, the whole with the whole full set of on wearing a set of half-plate walks in and walks up to the person and says, ah, 
SPEAKER3 2:37:40
are 
SPEAKER1 2:37:40
suspects of interest, I should say, although you're not necessarily suspects, I guess. Nice to meet you. I am 
SPEAKER3 2:37:50
Anthony House Cook. I'm the commander of the Dawnsguard. 
SPEAKER1 2:37:54
I am here to figure out and suss out what you need to do to resolve this issue. We're in the whole damn cave. That might be a solution. 
SPEAKER2 2:38:05
But I need to be more 
SPEAKER5 2:38:06
informed. Hold on a minute. There might be innocent children in there. Let's not get hasty. 
SPEAKER6 2:38:14
You're right, you're right. 
SPEAKER3 2:38:16
I 
SPEAKER2 2:38:16
My tone was a bit low. I need to discuss exactly what you all saw there. 
SPEAKER3 2:38:26
And what manner of 
SPEAKER1 2:38:28
support might be needed to 
SPEAKER2 2:38:29
expunge whatever evil is 
SPEAKER1 2:38:31
in place. 
SPEAKER3 2:38:32
I do not allow 
SPEAKER1 2:38:33
and do not tolerate what is going on in this town. 
SPEAKER3 2:38:39
So, 
SPEAKER6 2:38:40
if you wouldn't mind, 
SPEAKER1 2:38:44
please tell me everything that you've told my 
SPEAKER3 2:38:46
mission. I'm not going to make you 
SPEAKER2 2:38:52
roleplay that entire character again. But I just need to know, do you guys tell him all of the same things, or are you going to try to admit it? 
SPEAKER6 2:39:00
I'm going to try to admit it. I'm going to try to admit it. For all things, normally. Are you guys in agreement with that? 
SPEAKER5 2:39:05
Yeah, all things. All things that we told the other guy. Not all, all things. 
SPEAKER6 2:39:11
Yeah, yeah, that. 
SPEAKER5 2:39:13
Fucking genie's wish-ass motherfucker. We are not telling him everything. We are repeating the same things that we intentionally told the other man we are telling him now. 
SPEAKER3 2:39:24
Yes, 100% with that. 
SPEAKER5 2:39:29
We are not giving this man a natural 20 on perception so he can see the dice lords. That is not happening. 
SPEAKER3 2:39:36
As you are basically 
SPEAKER1 2:39:38
repeating through this explanation, 
SPEAKER2 2:39:40
everything up to getting the question from Miss Charlotte Amon to 
SPEAKER1 2:39:43
trying to, to running 
SPEAKER2 2:39:46
into the rogue at the Flux Crux, 
SPEAKER3 2:39:50
ending up in combat with 
SPEAKER2 2:39:51
the Red Ducks at the Opal Inn, finding the lead in the journal, 
SPEAKER3 2:39:56
going through the cave, you basically 
SPEAKER2 2:39:58
sum up everything as it happened 
SPEAKER1 2:40:00
as much as possible through the cave. As you are narrating this, 
SPEAKER3 2:40:04
he also takes a look at all of you. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:06
Takes a look over at you, 
SPEAKER1 2:40:08
takes a look over at yourself, 
SPEAKER2 2:40:10
takes a look at the various corpses that you've dumped in the other room. He interrupts that by saying, 
SPEAKER1 2:40:16
Scribe, take these creatures, 
SPEAKER2 2:40:18
get a couple of carriers or assistance, 
SPEAKER1 2:40:20
whatever you need, 
SPEAKER2 2:40:22
run them down to the guild hall, 
SPEAKER1 2:40:24
and get any information you can. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:26
I need to know what you are doing. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:28
I need to know what you are doing. 
SPEAKER1 2:40:30
I need to know what you are doing. I need to know what we're facing. Exactly what they can't do. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:36
You see four other individuals 
SPEAKER1 2:40:38
come up. 
SPEAKER2 2:40:40
They begin to load up the corpses of 
SPEAKER1 2:40:42
various creatures you've dumped, 
SPEAKER2 2:40:44
the intellect devourers, 
SPEAKER1 2:40:46
and begin to take them, cart them off. Then it goes back to you. Before he continues, Before he continues, 
SPEAKER5 2:40:54
I have a question for you. I have a question for you. 
SPEAKER3 2:40:58
Yes. 
SPEAKER5 2:41:00
How long I don't remember if we established this before or not, how long of examining someone's face does it take for me to figure out how it works? figure out how it works? 
SPEAKER2 2:41:12
We never actually determined that. We never actually determined that. 
SPEAKER6 2:41:16
Like, 
SPEAKER5 2:41:18
I imagine it would just be slight iterations I imagine it would just be slight iterations so I could get it, not just one glance, 
SPEAKER6 2:41:26
but I imagine I could get it 
SPEAKER5 2:41:28
10-15 minutes? 
SPEAKER1 2:41:30
10-15 minutes? 10-15 minutes? 
SPEAKER2 2:41:34
Hmm. 
SPEAKER1 2:41:36
Hmm. 
SPEAKER2 2:41:38
Let's see. 
SPEAKER6 2:41:40
Let's see. 
SPEAKER1 2:41:42
Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. 
SPEAKER2 2:41:48
Let's see. 
SPEAKER1 2:41:50
Let's see. 
SPEAKER6 2:41:52
Let's see. 
SPEAKER5 2:41:54
Sorry, not to derail. I need to know how long it takes 
SPEAKER3 2:41:58
because I have plans. 
SPEAKER2 2:42:00
I'll get back to you on that. I'll get back to you on that. 
SPEAKER5 2:42:04
Okay, would it be reasonable Okay, would it be reasonable to assume in the time he's here I would have the assumption that I could figure out what his face looked like and potentially the face of whatever scribe seems to be the closest to him? 
SPEAKER3 2:42:24
Let me get back to you on that. 
SPEAKER5 2:42:26
Okay, I would like to be examining Okay, I would like to be examining 
SPEAKER6 2:42:30
mostly him, also potentially the scribe. 
SPEAKER5 2:42:34
And I don't care, like, I'll blatantly stare at this guy. I'll blatantly stare at this guy. I'm not looking at him with creepy I'm not looking at him with creepy I want to wear your skin. But I'm gonna 
SPEAKER6 2:42:48
look at him and 
SPEAKER5 2:42:50
memorize his face. 
SPEAKER6 2:42:52
I don't care what it comes across as, really. 
SPEAKER5 2:42:54
I don't care what it comes across as, really. I mean, it could come across as I'm gonna eat your muscle. But like, you know. 
SPEAKER3 2:43:00
Pumboy has a good face, and I want it. 
SPEAKER5 2:43:02
Pumboy has a good face, and I want it. For wearing purposes. So, you know. 
SPEAKER6 2:43:08
You can't just kill people. 
SPEAKER5 2:43:12
He has a lovely face, and lovely eyes, 
SPEAKER1 2:43:14
and I just 
SPEAKER5 2:43:16
wanna wear it and impersonate him. He has a lovely face, lovely eyes, I wanna wear it. He's got great skin. I would like to wear it as my own. Permanently. 
SPEAKER3 2:43:26
You tell me how the rumblies only face can satisfy? 
SPEAKER5 2:43:28
Giving Carl 
SPEAKER6 2:43:30
Permanently. 
SPEAKER1 2:43:32
Give Carl that kills people. 
SPEAKER5 2:43:34
Give Carl that kills people. Well, I'm gonna, like, permanently kill him. 
SPEAKER1 2:43:40
Permanently? 
SPEAKER5 2:43:42
What do you mean, permanently? Okay, I'm not gonna- He won't be permanently dead. 
SPEAKER6 2:43:48
He'll just be- 
SPEAKER5 2:43:50
He'll just be slightly dead, mostly incapacitated, and, you know, he'll still be around, obviously. He'll still be getting his job done. 
SPEAKER4 2:43:58
Also, what are we waiting on for? 
SPEAKER5 2:44:00
We're waiting on Devon to decide how long it takes 
SPEAKER3 2:44:02
for me to- From what I can tell, there's no real determination 
SPEAKER2 2:44:06
on how long. I will say, by the end of this interaction, I'll be able to turn into Devon. 
SPEAKER5 2:44:12
To him and his, like, 
SPEAKER3 2:44:14
top scribe? Excellent. 
SPEAKER6 2:44:20
I begin to 
SPEAKER1 2:44:22
look deeper into this 
SPEAKER2 2:44:24
person's face, as they are wrapped and entrapped, listening to everything being talked about in terms of what is down in the cave, what your combat encounter was, what they were able to do. 
SPEAKER6 2:44:38
Um. 
SPEAKER2 2:44:40
I made a mistake in describing them. They are not, in fact, Hako. Or, uh, hold up. They are Drow. Sorry. I need to look at my notes. 
SPEAKER6 2:44:50
It's Gostin. 
SPEAKER2 2:44:52
I'm sorry. 
SPEAKER5 2:44:54
I needed to look at my- Huh? 
SPEAKER3 2:44:56
Are you a racist goblin? Uh, not yet. Okay. 
SPEAKER6 2:45:02
Drow's are racist towards everybody, what do you mean? 
SPEAKER5 2:45:04
Oh yeah, they're not racist towards everybody. They like other Drow, mostly, unless they're men. 
SPEAKER4 2:45:10
They would most likely spit in 
SPEAKER6 2:45:12
the face of a Tabaxi and then 
SPEAKER3 2:45:14
try to chop him up. 
SPEAKER5 2:45:16
Okay, and? 
SPEAKER3 2:45:18
Yeah, I'm racist against a fucking goddamn Drow. 
SPEAKER4 2:45:20
Maybe. It depends how nice they are. 
SPEAKER3 2:45:22
Wait, hold on, hold on. That's a 
SPEAKER2 2:45:24
coy thing to be like, okay, and, to get you spat in the face. 
SPEAKER4 2:45:28
Ehh. They're one and the same people now. Ayo. Canonically coy is, uh, 
SPEAKER6 2:45:36
is all they are. This way you never hear them talk at the same time. 
SPEAKER2 2:45:42
I've seen them in a room together, though. 
SPEAKER4 2:45:44
Yeah. Multiple times. That really wasn't. 
SPEAKER6 2:45:48
Multiple times, yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:45:50
I just hate a body actor. 
SPEAKER6 2:45:52
Exactly. 
SPEAKER5 2:45:54
I'm like four times the size of 
SPEAKER2 2:45:56
a coy. Okay, four coy's in a trench coat. 
SPEAKER5 2:46:00
Oh my god. 
SPEAKER3 2:46:02
Quote that, please. 
SPEAKER6 2:46:08
God, I hate it here. 
SPEAKER5 2:46:10
I'm actually offended. I'm actually offended only because I have better taste in food than coy. I would never even think of 
SPEAKER6 2:46:18
putting frickin' 
SPEAKER5 2:46:20
chicken nuggets in a hummus container. 
SPEAKER6 2:46:22
I've seen her put mayo 
SPEAKER3 2:46:24
in chicken nuggets. Think you're safe. 
SPEAKER5 2:46:26
Fuck all of y'all. 
SPEAKER3 2:46:28
I hate you all. 
SPEAKER5 2:46:30
All I wanna do is wear this guy's skin, knock him out kinda permanently, and steal his life. Okay? I'm innocent. Let us progress. I'm innocent! 
SPEAKER6 2:46:42
Dear god. 
SPEAKER5 2:46:44
Wait, who left? I hope we lost somebody. 
SPEAKER1 2:46:48
Hunter left. 
SPEAKER5 2:46:50
I just realized, Gizzard hasn't said anything this whole game. I am completely innocent. 
SPEAKER3 2:46:56
Okay, then. 
SPEAKER2 2:46:58
He said like two things. 
SPEAKER4 2:47:00
We're stuck in fuckin' dialogue 
SPEAKER3 2:47:02
forever because we keep going sidetracked. 
SPEAKER6 2:47:04
To be fair, 
SPEAKER5 2:47:06
though, it is fun. 
SPEAKER3 2:47:08
It is fun to sidetrack. It is. 
SPEAKER1 2:47:10
But... 
SPEAKER3 2:47:12
for the sake that we only get 
SPEAKER2 2:47:14
very rare chances. 
SPEAKER3 2:47:16
So anyway, moving forward. 
SPEAKER4 2:47:20
Straw figure. 
SPEAKER2 2:47:22
It's not blonde, it's silver hair. I have written this. 
SPEAKER4 2:47:26
Neat. The bald fucking drow. Silver hair! 
SPEAKER3 2:47:30
Anyway, moving on! 
SPEAKER2 2:47:32
Your account the entire story. It seems that this is much more dire of an issue than I had originally thought. 
SPEAKER4 2:47:40
I will consult with my scribe 
SPEAKER2 2:47:44
after they get back the intelligence. It looks like we may need to mobilize a force in the next coming days to go over and expunge whatever seems 
SPEAKER4 2:47:52
to be costing our safety. Days? Hours. 
SPEAKER2 2:47:56
Day, two hours. 
SPEAKER1 2:47:58
I believe I might be able to get a force 
SPEAKER4 2:48:00
together by the morning. I think that would be... 
SPEAKER1 2:48:04
Do you believe that you could 
SPEAKER4 2:48:06
accumulate and then rest 
SPEAKER2 2:48:08
and would be great to assist us to join us? 
SPEAKER4 2:48:10
Most of us. 
SPEAKER2 2:48:12
And it looks at the cat. 
SPEAKER4 2:48:14
And it looks at you, Jun and says, 
SPEAKER3 2:48:16
unfortunately I have no ability 
SPEAKER2 2:48:18
right now to get you back into fighting shape so quickly. I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it. I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it. 
SPEAKER1 2:48:26
There may be others in the city 
SPEAKER3 2:48:28
who have knowledge or who are still 
SPEAKER2 2:48:30
set on how to recover from such a need. Most of them that I would know would be adventurers 
SPEAKER3 2:48:36
at the guild or in the upcoming 
SPEAKER2 2:48:38
castle. But for now I believe that you may be best dressed or have any accommodations that you might have in the city. 
SPEAKER1 2:48:50
If you are to rest in the city 
SPEAKER3 2:48:52
rather than here, 
SPEAKER2 2:48:54
let us say that you are 
SPEAKER4 2:48:56
going to meet here again at... 
SPEAKER3 2:48:58
Let us have you meet here again at... 
SPEAKER4 2:49:00
Let us have you meet here again at... 
SPEAKER2 2:49:11
Let's say nine hours past the brightening of the lights. 
SPEAKER1 2:49:13
Correct the rest in layman's terms, that is, nine AM. 
SPEAKER2 2:49:15
Correct the rest in layman's terms, that is, nine AMając. Correct the rest in layman's terms, that is, nine AMounds. 
SPEAKER4 2:49:19
Turn the fucking lights on it. Oh, okay, it makes sense. Nevermind. Okay, yes. 
SPEAKER6 2:49:25
That sounds like a good idea. 
SPEAKER4 2:49:26
That sounds like a good idea. Would you have any supplies that we could possibly like... recoup our pain 
SPEAKER6 2:49:36
and suffering with? 
SPEAKER2 2:49:38
I will see what we may be able to spare. As we do not have a contract to pay the guild 
SPEAKER4 2:49:42
or the party in Virginia, 
SPEAKER2 2:49:44
I'm not sure exactly what we can provide, but we will get together and we can. 
SPEAKER1 2:49:48
Understood. 
SPEAKER2 2:49:50
Meiji, you will notice that normally in any sort of situation where the... 
SPEAKER4 2:49:56
government is acting alongside a party, 
SPEAKER2 2:49:58
they will prefer parties that are actually associated with the local guild, as they also have some sort of existing government and guild contract to provide provisions, arms, potions, 
SPEAKER3 2:50:08
and the like. 
SPEAKER2 2:50:10
You, Junoon, would also notice, as you've been adventuring long enough to know basically how some guilds work. There are other guilds in the world that are not associated with any government. For those, they are completely independent. 
SPEAKER3 2:50:22
And it is up to every party 
SPEAKER2 2:50:24
that utilizes the service of that guild or the building to basically stock and maintain it. So... 
SPEAKER1 2:50:30
For now, though, you may seek whatever other accommodations 
SPEAKER2 2:50:34
you may want to see. 
SPEAKER3 2:50:36
And we will send it for you. 
SPEAKER2 2:50:38
Understood. Free to go. The doctors that are working on YouTube, 
SPEAKER4 2:50:44
they do have a lot of information 
SPEAKER2 2:50:46
about the guilds and the services they provide. 
SPEAKER4 2:50:50
So, if you are interested in 
SPEAKER2 2:50:52
the guilds, we can help you out of the bed if you are leaving. And bring you to the wheelchair. 
SPEAKER6 2:51:04
I suppose I might have an idea. Junoon will nod. 
SPEAKER1 2:51:14
Thank you. 
SPEAKER4 2:51:22
And he... 
SPEAKER5 2:51:24
nod, agreeing that he'd like to be put in the wheelchair he has. 
SPEAKER6 2:51:28
He wants to test something out. 
SPEAKER2 2:51:30
Okay. They begin, and they lower you into the wheelchair itself. It's... It's mostly of wooden construction. It's not great. 
SPEAKER4 2:51:40
But... 
SPEAKER2 2:51:42
it's moving. 
SPEAKER4 2:51:44
Um... Junoon... 
SPEAKER3 2:51:48
is going to use his telekinetic feet 
SPEAKER6 2:51:50
slash mage hand 
SPEAKER4 2:51:52
Junoon is going to use his telekinetic feet to push 
SPEAKER1 2:51:56
the wheelchair. 
SPEAKER4 2:51:58
She truly is. Professor X. 
SPEAKER5 2:52:02
Magic man! No one can see the mage hand. No one knows Junoon has 
SPEAKER6 2:52:08
telekinetic feet. 
SPEAKER4 2:52:10
He's just gonna push it. 
SPEAKER2 2:52:12
Nope. You all see Junoon sitting down in the chair. That girl begins to be ready to be pushed. Before you all see the brow furrow and the chair just begins to move 
SPEAKER4 2:52:22
on its own. You're like, oh. Uh... 
SPEAKER2 2:52:26
Okay. I'll just leave you there. 
SPEAKER6 2:52:32
I'm gonna look at the guard. 
SPEAKER4 2:52:34
Can you teach me how to do this? Can you teach me how to do this? 
SPEAKER5 2:52:38
Can you teach me how to do this? 
SPEAKER2 2:52:40
I don't know what that was. Did... 
SPEAKER5 2:52:44
You bought the chair somewhere? 
SPEAKER2 2:52:46
Is that? 
SPEAKER4 2:52:48
That was a normal chair. 
SPEAKER3 2:52:50
Then did you buy the chair? 
SPEAKER2 2:52:52
I don't know who bought the chair. I just have the chair. I am. 
SPEAKER4 2:52:54
But it is a chair with wheels 
SPEAKER5 2:52:56
that moves on its own. 
SPEAKER2 2:52:58
I didn't know it moved on its own. 
SPEAKER5 2:53:02
Do you know where I might find the name of your supplier? 
SPEAKER6 2:53:04
I just work here. I don't know. 
SPEAKER4 2:53:06
I just work here. I don't know. I just work here. I don't know. Do you understand the 
SPEAKER5 2:53:12
implications of this? We could potentially... If you have a chair with wheels that can move on its own, potentially we can use this to destroy some of these monsters. Because they attack anything that moves on its own. 
SPEAKER2 2:53:24
to destroy some of these monsters. 
SPEAKER5 2:53:26
You're a genius! I'm gonna grab the man and shake him and be like You're an absolute genius! 
SPEAKER3 2:53:32
You're a genius! 
SPEAKER4 2:53:34
You're fantastic! 
SPEAKER3 2:53:36
You're a genius! 
SPEAKER5 2:53:38
He's gonna kind of snicker to himself. Pull out his bag of holding. 
SPEAKER6 2:53:42
Pull a flask 
SPEAKER5 2:53:44
out of his bag of holding. 
SPEAKER6 2:53:46
This flask seems to have some type of substance in it. 
SPEAKER5 2:53:52
Maybe dirt? 
SPEAKER4 2:53:54
Maybe dirt? 
SPEAKER6 2:53:56
Some type of substance too. 
SPEAKER4 2:53:58
Unknown substance too. Literally everybody. 
SPEAKER5 2:54:04
Other than Michi. Michi knows exactly 
SPEAKER4 2:54:06
what's in there. 
SPEAKER6 2:54:08
While I was in the afterlife, 
SPEAKER5 2:54:12
I did meet an old friend 
SPEAKER4 2:54:14
of yours. And uh... 
SPEAKER5 2:54:18
We were good. 
SPEAKER6 2:54:20
We became some good pals for the uh... few minutes that we were 
SPEAKER4 2:54:26
up there. And uh... Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 2:54:32
He's 
SPEAKER5 2:54:34
he's deciding to help me out right now. 
SPEAKER3 2:54:36
He's the one who's pushing me. 
SPEAKER6 2:54:38
Oh. Michi's 
SPEAKER3 2:54:44
just gonna stare at him like he's fucking crazy. 
SPEAKER5 2:54:48
You mean to say a dead man 
SPEAKER6 2:54:50
is pushing you? 
SPEAKER5 2:54:52
Well how else? How else would I be moving? 
SPEAKER3 2:54:56
I clearly have 
SPEAKER5 2:54:58
one leg and one arm. So there's no application of the chair? Go ahead and grab me. Pick me up. Grab the chair. 
SPEAKER6 2:55:10
But we can't... 
SPEAKER5 2:55:12
It's not... It's just a chair. 
SPEAKER6 2:55:14
There's not... Hmm... 
SPEAKER5 2:55:18
Does this have to go under re-advisement? Would you like to... I'm gonna pat the guard on the shoulder. I'm sure you're still a genius. Would you like to take the chair for a spin? Good question. 
SPEAKER6 2:55:28
Would you, Songhan, 
SPEAKER3 2:55:30
have any idea, like, be able to kinda notice what's going on? I would also like to 
SPEAKER5 2:55:36
insight check. 
SPEAKER1 2:55:38
Yeah. 
SPEAKER2 2:55:40
Sure. Insight check and and... Do an insight check. 
SPEAKER3 2:55:46
Junyun, do a deception or persuasion check. This is insight? 
SPEAKER5 2:55:54
Persuasion or 
SPEAKER1 2:55:56
perception. Persuasion or deception. 
SPEAKER6 2:56:00
Or, deception, sorry. 
SPEAKER1 2:56:02
Both of them are plus zero. 
SPEAKER5 2:56:04
Oh! Nat 20! 
SPEAKER3 2:56:06
Oh! Oh, this is lovely. 
SPEAKER6 2:56:10
This is playing out 
SPEAKER5 2:56:12
so lovely. 
SPEAKER3 2:56:14
Hey, Jeezer, would you make a perception check as well? 
SPEAKER1 2:56:16
Sure. Perception, go. 6. 6. 
SPEAKER6 2:56:28
Michi's just gonna put her hand on her fuckin' head. There ain't no way. There's just no way. 
SPEAKER2 2:56:34
Forrest, in Songhan, 
SPEAKER3 2:56:36
I mean, you don't know that Frollo couldn't keep 
SPEAKER2 2:56:38
pushing from the afterlife. 
SPEAKER3 2:56:40
The ashes are in their hand. They said they met them. 
SPEAKER2 2:56:44
So... For you, Forrest, maybe that's how magic works? In Songhan, maybe that's what being resurrected does? 
SPEAKER3 2:56:56
In Songhan is watching this with the next amazed, like, 
SPEAKER5 2:57:04
I'm trying to find a 
SPEAKER6 2:57:06
if, like, um... 
SPEAKER1 2:57:08
He's 
SPEAKER5 2:57:10
watching with the most, like, 
SPEAKER3 2:57:12
amazed 
SPEAKER6 2:57:14
expression, like, 
SPEAKER3 2:57:16
wait, what? This isn't in anything he remembers studying, this isn't in any books he read, he has access to a whole, like, encyclopedia on the whole lore of the realms, he doesn't know what any of this is, he's just... 
SPEAKER6 2:57:30
This must be some, like, you know, extra play in our involvement, 
SPEAKER1 2:57:34
he's just, his mind is blown, he's just staring at you, like, I have to know how that chair works. 
SPEAKER6 2:57:46
Welcome to Maurice Halster's 
SPEAKER3 2:57:48
Well, I suppose, um... 
SPEAKER5 2:57:50
We will have to find another strategy for getting in to attack something first. 
SPEAKER6 2:57:56
We could... 
SPEAKER5 2:57:58
This will do to get me around, 
SPEAKER3 2:58:00
I will... 
SPEAKER6 2:58:02
I can throw dots, but... 
SPEAKER5 2:58:06
This won't do me in any other 
SPEAKER6 2:58:08
combat. We'll 
SPEAKER3 2:58:12
find a solution. I think my... 
SPEAKER6 2:58:16
If you're up to it, the idea 
SPEAKER3 2:58:18
of potentially making something for you? 
SPEAKER5 2:58:20
For now? 
SPEAKER6 2:58:24
Is a possibility. Is a possibility. Hmm... 
SPEAKER1 2:58:30
Hmm... 
SPEAKER6 2:58:32
Hmm... I'll have to ponder it. 
SPEAKER1 2:58:36
I'll have to ponder it. 
SPEAKER3 2:58:38
Very well, I won't push it. But, if you need a hand, 
SPEAKER6 2:58:42
well, we can find you one. 
SPEAKER5 2:58:46
Janune looks very unamused. 
SPEAKER6 2:58:48
Janune looks very unamused. 
SPEAKER1 2:58:50
So, where are you guys all heading? 
SPEAKER2 2:58:52
So, where are you guys all heading? 
SPEAKER1 2:58:54
I think we should head to 
SPEAKER4 2:58:56
I think we should head to 
SPEAKER3 2:58:58
the Old Crown, if we still have our rooms there. the Old Crown, if we still have our rooms there. Or we should also maybe check in on Charlotte. Or we should also maybe check in on Charlotte. 
SPEAKER1 2:59:06
It's been a while. That would be a good idea. 
SPEAKER6 2:59:10
Do we want to potentially save up 
SPEAKER3 2:59:12
Do we want to potentially save up so we don't get so we don't get 
SPEAKER1 2:59:18
a brief grabbing of the utensils? grabbing of the utensils? The utility? 
SPEAKER6 2:59:26
The utility? The life-saving nectar that is breathing? 
SPEAKER1 2:59:30
The utility? The life-saving nectar that is breathing? What? The fucking potions. 
SPEAKER5 2:59:38
Did we all hear him correctly? 
SPEAKER6 2:59:40
Yes. I don't know what I heard. 
SPEAKER3 2:59:44
I meant to say life-saving nectar fucking drinking a potion. 
SPEAKER5 2:59:48
We all misheard him correctly. 
SPEAKER1 2:59:50
Yeah, no, I was having a fucking moment, okay? 
SPEAKER3 2:59:52
Leave me alone. No, so, just 
SPEAKER5 2:59:54
we didn't mishear you then. 
SPEAKER2 2:59:56
We heard you correctly. You said something. 
SPEAKER1 2:59:58
Do you want some fucking potions 
SPEAKER3 3:00:00
so we can fucking survive 
SPEAKER5 3:00:02
and not get our face pummeled or eaten again? 
SPEAKER1 3:00:04
and not get our face pummeled or eaten again? 
SPEAKER3 3:00:08
I've exhausted all my supplies 
SPEAKER6 3:00:10
last round for everybody. Yeah. 
SPEAKER4 3:00:14
Yes, a rest would be great. Yes, a rest would be great. 
SPEAKER3 3:00:18
Let's check in on Charlotte and then we go 
SPEAKER1 3:00:22
and have nap time. 
SPEAKER6 3:00:24
and then we go and have nap time. All opposed? All opposed? 
SPEAKER1 3:00:32
Uh, we Alright. nap and then wake up at nine and then leave out again? 
SPEAKER6 3:00:40
and then leave out again? Yes. Yes. 
SPEAKER1 3:00:46
Yes, I'm not so you can wake up 
SPEAKER3 3:00:48
a little earlier, but I'm sleeping in. 
SPEAKER1 3:00:50
I mean. I mean. I prefer to get it done while the day is still fresh enough, I prefer to get it done while the day is still fresh enough, even if I'm hurting, because we don't know what might transpire through the night. For context, um, it is already the middle of the night. Oh, thank you. That makes it better for me to understand if it is day or night. No, it is midnight thirty. Then nighttime it is. Sleepy time. 
SPEAKER3 3:01:18
Uh, for our own wonder travel, there actually is a world plot. 
SPEAKER1 3:01:22
Does it function? Because I've been asking you about that for like months. 
SPEAKER6 3:01:26
Did you set the time? 
SPEAKER1 3:01:28
Yes, I did set the time. 
SPEAKER5 3:01:30
It was 1224 AM. 
SPEAKER1 3:01:32
Oh, wow. 
SPEAKER6 3:01:34
I didn't know you actually fucking adjusted the time clock 
SPEAKER1 3:01:36
after the fourth time I asked. 
SPEAKER3 3:01:38
No, not only is it adjusted, but it has the actual calendar 
SPEAKER1 3:01:40
for this world in it. Congratulations, I'm proud of you. Okay then. 
SPEAKER6 3:01:46
I'm with you on this one then. 
SPEAKER1 3:01:48
Huzzah! Let us roll. If anybody opposes, 
SPEAKER6 3:01:54
well, you're dicked. 
SPEAKER1 3:01:58
Okay, so which inn are you headed to? The inn that 
SPEAKER3 3:02:04
we have a place at, which is the 
SPEAKER6 3:02:06
Okay, the old town. Cool. 
SPEAKER1 3:02:08
Just wanted to make sure. Why wouldn't you go to the... 
SPEAKER3 3:02:12
I just wanted to make sure, right? 
SPEAKER1 3:02:14
Y'all do wild things sometimes. I'm not going to fucking Jezzer's Roach Motel. It's not actually the same. It's a place of chiefs. 
SPEAKER5 3:02:26
Hey, they are our friends 
SPEAKER3 3:02:28
and they are named George. This isn't Jill's apartment. Why did you name them George? 
SPEAKER5 3:02:34
My grandma did. All the roaches in her house and motels 
SPEAKER3 3:02:36
that we ever went to, they were all named George. 
SPEAKER5 3:02:38
Alright. 
SPEAKER3 3:02:40
As you were saying, Devon, I'm going to go and say 
SPEAKER1 3:02:44
nope. 
SPEAKER3 3:02:46
We don't need to punish Koi. Just back to 
SPEAKER6 3:02:50
something else before punishing Koi. 
SPEAKER1 3:02:52
I think Koi is your friend. 
SPEAKER6 3:02:54
Jesus. 
SPEAKER2 3:02:56
What do you mean? 
SPEAKER1 3:02:58
As you were saying, Devon. 
SPEAKER6 3:03:00
I'm not saying that. 
SPEAKER1 3:03:02
I'm not saying that. 
SPEAKER6 3:03:04
Just chill, Devon. Oh my goodness. 
SPEAKER5 3:03:08
Damn it. Why were roaches 
SPEAKER2 3:03:12
such an issue in your house? 
SPEAKER3 3:03:14
It was my grandma's 
SPEAKER5 3:03:16
house and I don't know, man. I thought they were just like 
SPEAKER1 3:03:20
something people get sometimes. What do you mean? 
SPEAKER3 3:03:24
I don't know, man. 
SPEAKER1 3:03:26
I think every time you learn more Koi than work, 
SPEAKER3 3:03:28
it's more like, ah yeah, it's sad. 
SPEAKER1 3:03:30
I live in an extreme poverty. 
SPEAKER5 3:03:32
It doesn't even that, like, extremely poor, man. I mean, pocklaces are fairly common in a lot of places in the US. 
SPEAKER1 3:03:40
That's true. I guess. This was Houston, Texas. 
SPEAKER5 3:03:44
Also, I'm not superstitious. 
SPEAKER3 3:03:46
Like, my grandma swore her house was haunted and one time at night, I woke up to legitimately what sounded like someone just talking in the room but like, obscuring, kind of whispering and it freaked me the fuck out. 
SPEAKER6 3:04:00
And like, it could have been anything. 
SPEAKER3 3:04:02
It could have been sound traveling. But it freaked me the fuck out because it was like, 
SPEAKER4 3:04:06
I woke up from sleep to this. 
SPEAKER6 3:04:08
And it was loud. 
SPEAKER3 3:04:10
And then I woke up in the morning and my grandma was like, oh yeah, my house is haunted. 
SPEAKER5 3:04:14
And I was like, that's not comforting. 
SPEAKER1 3:04:16
She's like, no, but it's a really nice ghost. 
SPEAKER5 3:04:18
I thought it was still terrifying. 
SPEAKER6 3:04:20
Don't be scared. 
SPEAKER3 3:04:22
It still freaked me the fuck out. 
SPEAKER6 3:04:24
Sorry, meant to be annoying. 
SPEAKER5 3:04:28
Don't worry, the ghost isn't gonna kill you. 
SPEAKER6 3:04:30
I just choked. 
SPEAKER1 3:04:32
Choking on alcohol, listening to Koi 
SPEAKER6 3:04:34
and her fucking stories. What? It's not that weird, is it? 
SPEAKER1 3:04:38
Yeah. 
SPEAKER5 3:04:40
That's fairly out there. 
SPEAKER1 3:04:42
You've got some Joe's apartment-ass shit going on. 
SPEAKER5 3:04:44
Got some what shit? That one is fairly out there, Koi. Yeah, that was kinda weird. 
SPEAKER6 3:04:50
It could have been anything. 
SPEAKER5 3:04:52
It just, the noise freaked me out. 
SPEAKER3 3:04:54
And then my grandma being like, 
SPEAKER1 3:04:56
oh, it's a really nice ghost. My house is haunted. 
SPEAKER6 3:05:00
Did not help. I was like, please. No. Wait. 
SPEAKER1 3:05:06
Y'all, 
SPEAKER5 3:05:08
y'all approach 
SPEAKER1 3:05:10
the old crown. Moving through the Commerce District. Which normally, during most hours of the day, has at least some light. But now, seeing this vacant, just quiet, it's almost eerie. You find it's just a mist of pain. The sound of this river. And lacking any of that 
SPEAKER6 3:05:30
material context of conversation about carts, commerce, and its cycles. But eventually you do find a gilded arches 
SPEAKER1 3:05:40
in front of the old crown. 
SPEAKER6 3:05:42
And you're like, I'm not gonna go through the cornfield and I'll kiss you. The door is closed. The Roman arch is not the fucking 
SPEAKER1 3:05:52
golden arch's chief. 
SPEAKER6 3:05:54
All right. 
SPEAKER3 3:05:56
I'll make a coalition with this place. 
SPEAKER6 3:05:58
I swear to Christ. He's itching to do it. I am itching to do it. Anyway. I've done it once. I'll do it again. 
SPEAKER1 3:06:10
And I'll do it again. 
SPEAKER5 3:06:12
I'm gonna do it again. I'm gonna do it again. I'm gonna do it again. 
SPEAKER6 3:06:18
Duh. 
SPEAKER1 3:06:20
Pass. Not one. Not two. 
SPEAKER6 3:06:24
In total you pass about four different 
SPEAKER1 3:06:28
gaggling collections of cards that have been thrown through. And unlike most of the top three large doors that actively enter in here are open. 
SPEAKER6 3:06:40
A small little 
SPEAKER1 3:06:42
tavern style, like Old West saloon style doors are left open. This time 
SPEAKER2 3:06:48
the actual gilded doors are closed. 
SPEAKER1 3:06:50
You have to knock before they are opened. You are asked what your business is. My room. That is my business. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:02
Any official issues on there? 
SPEAKER1 3:07:04
Me chi. One moment. Let me see if I can close the door. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:12
Moments later it opens again. 
SPEAKER1 3:07:14
Ah yes. Your rooms are still there. You can go right this way. Thank you. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:20
He lets all of you in and then looks at Jizzard and Ignatius and is like, ah actually 
SPEAKER1 3:07:24
um. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:26
We had permission. We had permission. Hold on. As long as he is to behave 
SPEAKER4 3:07:30
he may stay. Am I the owner of you? The innkeeper 
SPEAKER3 3:07:36
in the morning. I forget her name. Very beautiful lady though. 
SPEAKER6 3:07:40
Make persuasion check. What? 
SPEAKER3 3:07:44
She was beautiful. 
SPEAKER1 3:07:46
No no. Persuasion. Oh. Fuck. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:50
What we gotta leave him outside in a doghouse? 
SPEAKER1 3:07:54
Yes. Make sure you keep a leash on him. 
SPEAKER3 3:07:58
Anybody going to vouch for this? Anybody wanna speak up? 
SPEAKER1 3:08:06
Don't look at me. I'm just stump. Stump on a fucking log. Alright. Well. That's sixteen. 
SPEAKER6 3:08:18
It says. 
SPEAKER1 3:08:22
Circumstances. 
SPEAKER3 3:08:26
We stay in your room. You are responsible. 
SPEAKER1 3:08:28
Any damage is harassment to other clients. You know what? In that case, we can whore him out for you and you can use him as you want. That is not something to like. He's not affiliated with any of these services. Very true. Well, then he is responsible for his own damages. As a patron, responsible if you want. 
SPEAKER3 3:08:50
But you're welcome to your room. 
SPEAKER1 3:08:52
Will you clear this matter with regards though? 
SPEAKER5 3:08:54
They have told us that he is to be 
SPEAKER1 3:08:56
associated. 
SPEAKER6 3:08:58
Associated. 
SPEAKER1 3:09:00
Associated with who? 
SPEAKER6 3:09:02
Associated with who? 
SPEAKER1 3:09:04
Associated with who? Associated with who? 
SPEAKER5 3:09:08
The matter. They are under contract and we are trying to get it done. Hmm. He is lying. Likewise bound in the same manner. 
SPEAKER1 3:09:16
Yes, what I'm saying is that all of you will be responsible if your friend here decides to do something untoward. 
SPEAKER6 3:09:24
And what we are saying is 
SPEAKER5 3:09:26
he has come here with us at the behest of the guards 
SPEAKER1 3:09:30
and so it should be their responsibility. 
SPEAKER5 3:09:32
And once again, I am saying look at me. What am I to do if it gets loose and tries to do something? 
SPEAKER1 3:09:40
What am I to do if it gets loose and tries to do something? You could eat him. Janu just looks down. 
SPEAKER6 3:09:48
Janu just looks down. 
SPEAKER1 3:09:50
Right. 
SPEAKER3 3:09:52
Alright, of course, we just have to check this. 
SPEAKER1 3:09:54
Make a persuasion check now. Make a persuasion check now. 
SPEAKER6 3:09:58
Come on. 
SPEAKER5 3:10:00
I have a plus nine. 
SPEAKER1 3:10:02
Yeah, the dice just don't like you. Yeah, the dice just don't like you. 
SPEAKER5 3:10:06
They never do. 
SPEAKER1 3:10:08
They never do. Let's see if you have Let's see if you have I just promised that I won't I just promised that I won't go missing tonight. Understood. 
SPEAKER4 3:10:22
That is the entire reason we are here 
SPEAKER5 3:10:24
is to keep people from stopping going missing. 
SPEAKER1 3:10:26
So yes. And we go in. And we go in. And you know that the tavern itself is dark. No music comes from the employer. 
SPEAKER3 3:10:40
There are no guests in the lobby. 
SPEAKER1 3:10:42
And the bars and tables are surrounded by a dark room. 
SPEAKER6 3:10:46
Essentially, this entire area 
SPEAKER1 3:10:48
is based on a dark room. But, the silence was able to make it up to your rooms. The silence was able to make it up to your rooms. In whichever order you all want to camp out, 
SPEAKER6 3:11:00
I believe you had two rooms, correct? 
SPEAKER1 3:11:04
I think we had one room with multiple beds. Okay. 
SPEAKER6 3:11:08
But the one room 
SPEAKER1 3:11:10
where you are able to essentially find out you are able to essentially figure out how you are arranging yourself with the space of your stomach. 
SPEAKER3 3:11:22
With all of you in there, it is a creative experience. 
SPEAKER1 3:11:32
Pretty, uh, pretty small here. Well, Michi's gonna grab a blanket and a pillow and curl up in a corner. Actually, hold up. No, I'm not gonna touch that blanket yet. Michi is going to go run a fucking bath. 
SPEAKER3 3:11:58
Coded in disguise. Isang-hun will investigate the matter of Jun-Eun's incredible chair that somehow defies all rules of magic, which he knows at the moment. 
SPEAKER1 3:12:16
He must learn its mysteries. Alright. Go ahead and roll investigation if you so want. Okay. 
SPEAKER3 3:12:28
Okay, so while Jun-Eun's 
SPEAKER1 3:12:30
just kinda parked in the room, the bird Parked. 
SPEAKER5 3:12:36
Put it in reverse. Back it up. 
SPEAKER1 3:12:38
So, while Jun-Eun is just parked, you know, doing whatever he's doing, minding his own business, uh, 
SPEAKER3 3:12:46
Isang-hun's gonna wander up to him. 
SPEAKER1 3:12:48
Uh, this scraggly, but at least now dried bird, uh, he's just gonna start not even asking, he's just gonna kinda start looking over the chair inquisitively. Yes! This is a normal-looking wheelchair. He's mystified. He's looked at like 
SPEAKER5 3:13:20
every little crack in it, like he's looked 
SPEAKER1 3:13:22
pretty damn well into it, and, you know, he's uh, he's, well, reversed, reversed in magic, like, uh, you know, he's gonna know signs of like how things like this might work, but he's not seeing anything. He's gonna look up at Jun-Eun with like a very inquisitive face, um, and just kinda, without speaking, just, it's very much asking, How? 
SPEAKER5 3:13:54
Oh, by the way, your little fairy friend told me to relay a message to you. 
SPEAKER1 3:14:04
Gonna look kinda skeptical at Jun-Eun, but he's curious. 
SPEAKER6 3:14:12
Jun-Eun will just... Jun-Eun will just... 
SPEAKER5 3:14:16
Jun-Eun will just... He'll, he'll lean in 
SPEAKER1 3:14:20
close to the bird, 
SPEAKER5 3:14:22
and he'll, he'll have 
SPEAKER1 3:14:24
his one arm, he'll 
SPEAKER3 3:14:26
he'll be like, Come here! Like, uh, I don't, I don't know 
SPEAKER6 3:14:30
how he just got, but like he'll 
SPEAKER1 3:14:32
like do the whole hand thing where he like 
SPEAKER6 3:14:34
tries to pull him in. 
SPEAKER5 3:14:36
Not pull him in, but like 
SPEAKER1 3:14:38
that hand gesture. 
SPEAKER5 3:14:40
Yeah, yeah. He somehow will lean in, just like, 
SPEAKER1 3:14:42
just, just enough to, to hear him closer. 
SPEAKER6 3:14:46
A little closer. Oh, sorry, 
SPEAKER5 3:14:52
I gotta close my bow. One sec. 
SPEAKER1 3:14:54
What was that? 
SPEAKER5 3:14:56
A little closer. 
SPEAKER1 3:14:58
He leans in, very cautiously, like, 
SPEAKER5 3:15:02
just leaning in closer, 
SPEAKER6 3:15:04
closer. Nnnniddle closer. 
SPEAKER1 3:15:10
He's fog-eyed. 
SPEAKER5 3:15:12
Leaning in pretty fucking close now. 
SPEAKER1 3:15:14
His ear is almost right up to Jun-Eun's face, almost. 
SPEAKER5 3:15:28
Jun-Eun, hold then. 
SPEAKER6 3:15:34
I don't know if I wanna be mean or not. Yeah, I'll be mean. 
SPEAKER1 3:15:40
I know. 
SPEAKER5 3:15:42
He's going to, not super hard, but kinda like, semi-slap, but mostly push down on In-Sung-Kwang's 
SPEAKER1 3:15:56
beak, and then boop him. We go 
SPEAKER5 3:16:00
slap, and then boop! 
SPEAKER6 3:16:02
That's what you get 
SPEAKER1 3:16:04
for leaving me. Sung-Eun kind of taken off guard, like his, 
SPEAKER5 3:16:10
you know, like his head kind of 
SPEAKER1 3:16:12
follows with the beak. 
SPEAKER5 3:16:14
So he's kind of definitely pushed around with this. And he'll kind of stumble back, 
SPEAKER1 3:16:18
uh, and look at Jun-Eun like really offended, and almost like accusational, but he'll just turn abruptly 
SPEAKER6 3:16:30
and just walk away. 
SPEAKER1 3:16:32
Just turn the other way and go back to kind of his little own spot in the room. 
SPEAKER5 3:16:38
Hey, don't be so angry, fella. You've still got an arm and a leg. Look on the bright side. 
SPEAKER6 3:16:46
You can still walk. 
SPEAKER1 3:16:50
Sung-Eun 
SPEAKER5 3:16:52
is not really facing Jun-Eun anymore. 
SPEAKER6 3:16:54
He's kind of just 
SPEAKER1 3:16:56
on his bed, sitting the opposite direction, uh, ignoring him now, but he does, he does acknowledge this. He'll kind of, his shoulders get a little less tense. At least that's what's visible. He'll definitely kind of soften up a bit and just do his thing. He's just kind of curling up on his spot. Jun-Eun and Hort, what are you doing? Thinking about what happened. Yeah. 
SPEAKER6 3:17:40
Let's see if my little bed that I made up is still there. 
SPEAKER1 3:17:50
So room service has really come through. They haven't destroyed it, but they have done 
SPEAKER6 3:17:56
some kind of refolding 
SPEAKER1 3:17:58
for the room. I sort 
SPEAKER4 3:18:02
of like, 
SPEAKER3 3:18:04
pretty sure if I remember correctly, I brought in like a bunch of leaves and 
SPEAKER4 3:18:08
like grass and stuff 
SPEAKER3 3:18:10
and like made a little bed. 
SPEAKER4 3:18:12
So in the corner, did they like, did they destroy it? That's me in the corner. 
SPEAKER1 3:18:18
That's me in the spot. That's me in the spot. Are you claiming a bed? 
SPEAKER5 3:18:28
Are you taking a floor? 
SPEAKER6 3:18:32
Nah, probably going for the floor. 
SPEAKER1 3:18:34
Probably going for the floor. Oh. 
SPEAKER6 3:18:38
I brush my teeth 
SPEAKER1 3:18:40
and look in the mirror. 
SPEAKER6 3:18:42
And laugh 
SPEAKER1 3:18:44
And laugh And laugh 
SPEAKER5 3:18:48
I think I'm just gonna be chillin'. 
SPEAKER6 3:18:50
Um. Not going to sleep yet. 
SPEAKER1 3:18:54
I want to 
SPEAKER6 3:18:56
pay attention to people and um 
SPEAKER5 3:19:00
I am currently an elf, so I don't need to 
SPEAKER6 3:19:02
sleep as much. And... 
SPEAKER5 3:19:06

SPEAKER6 3:19:10
I'm gonna go to bed. 
SPEAKER1 3:19:12
I'm gonna go to bed. 
SPEAKER6 3:19:14
I'm gonna go to bed. 
SPEAKER1 3:19:16
Well, because Michi's the only one who said that they're actually drawing up a shot of that, 
SPEAKER6 3:19:22
Michi, 
SPEAKER3 3:19:24
everyone else is pretty self-settling. 
SPEAKER1 3:19:26
She's in an orgy, still covered in tape and dirt, 
SPEAKER6 3:19:30
not hard to edit their own blood. 
SPEAKER1 3:19:34
June has been for the most part cleaned by the doctors at the camp. 
SPEAKER6 3:19:40
June has been 
SPEAKER3 3:19:42
in some kind of 
SPEAKER6 3:19:44
thoroughly soaked, dried 
SPEAKER1 3:19:46
bed. 
SPEAKER2 3:19:48
Forrest being 
SPEAKER1 3:19:50
still caked in dirt but not blood. We're all really just settled in 21. We'll see if it goes well for the next session. Besides we're gonna hit instead of something weird. Bye. Bye. 
SPEAKER4 3:20:10
Blessed be. Next session, 
SPEAKER2 3:20:14
prepare to have a morning, have a night, or have a night, 
SPEAKER1 3:20:20
but that'd be so bad. 
SPEAKER2 3:20:22
I need to figure out 
SPEAKER1 3:20:24
why I need to stop 
SPEAKER2 3:20:26
stop and play. It's just that. Okay. 
SPEAKER1 3:20:32
I'm gonna go to bed. I'm gonna go to bed. I'm gonna go to bed. 
SPEAKER2 3:20:38
Any questions, any thoughts, any notes? 
SPEAKER1 3:20:42
Or I stop recording. 
SPEAKER5 3:20:48
I would like the recording to show that I am innocent. 
SPEAKER2 3:20:54
I like 
SPEAKER6 3:20:56
I like the record to show that I did not get told how many 
SPEAKER3 3:21:02
crystals I got from that wall when I initially dug it. Hold up the playtick note. 
SPEAKER2 3:21:08
I rolled it, you know. 
SPEAKER3 3:21:10
Yep, that's exactly what I was about to say. Okay, you know what? You know what? Here.

Gross capping. 
SPEAKER2 3:21:36
Why would I cap?
